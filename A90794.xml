            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2 E. 6. in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> and upon the ſea a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt did ariſe, and endanger the drowning of the ſhip; for the ſafety whereof, and of the men and goods in it, he caſts part of the Woad into the ſea, and after (arrives at the Port with the reſidue; and before the landing, <hi>Fogaſſa</hi> came to the Collector of the Subſidie, and ſhewed unto him the accident afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and that by reaſon thereof, he knew not the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of the remnant, and prayed him to make entry of 2000. Kintals of Woad, which he ſuppoſed were left; and if more were remaining, then he would pay Cuſtom for it according to the rate when the certainty ſhould appear; and deſired licence for to land it,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:120227:6"/>which was granted; and before the woad was weighed, <hi>Reniger</hi> informed againſt him for landing 1693 Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of woad more then 4500. Kintals, the Subſidie not paid, nor the Collector agreed with for it; to which he pleaded the matter aforeſaid, and concluded; and <hi>ſuper hoc,</hi> he did agree, and upon the agreement Iſſue was taken, and the Defendant gave in evidence, the eſpecial agreement aforeſaid, and upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the King Demurs, and adjudged for <hi>Fogaſſa</hi> the Defendant, by force of a Privy Seal ſent by the King to that purpoſe. But the opinion of all the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Barons, except <hi>Hales</hi> and <hi>Montague,</hi> were with the Defendant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For that this agreement <hi>incertain,</hi> and <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal,</hi> is an agreement, and ſo ſaith the words of the Statute, which ſufficeth, becauſe the Statute is penal, and ſhall be expounded ſtrictly againſt offenders, and ſhall not be intended beneficial for the King to be an agreement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Admit it to be an Agreement, yet here this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie</hi> is reducible to a <hi>certaintie,</hi> by circumſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> by weighing, which ſhall be done by the Collector at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Admit that the agreement ought to be <hi>certain</hi> at firſt, yet here the caſting out of the woad for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of greater miſchief, <hi>viz.</hi> The drowning of the ſhip, men, and goods, the neceſſity, for the avoiding of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger of death, the compulſion, for fear of death, cauſed his ignorance to be <hi>involuntary,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, his agreement <hi>incertain,</hi> every one of which by it ſelf, may diſpence with any law, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When the defendant pleads a <hi>special agreement</hi> in the Affirmative, and concludes upon it, <hi>&amp; ſuper hoc</hi> agreement, the concluſion hath not waved the matter aforeſaid, as if it had been in the Negative.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:120227:6"/> 5. He had performed the intent of the Statute by this agreement, for when the Collector hath weighed the woad, that he may do his pleaſure, then the King ſhall have an action upon the agreement, and if he doth not weigh, it is the folly of the Collector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Griffith,</hi> the Kings Sollicitor. Agreement, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> executed with ſatisfaction in deed, or with accord, or means for recovery of recompence, is a good bar in Treſpaſs; Executory is not; howbeit, it is the mutual aſſent of the parties, becauſe it giveth neither recompence, action, nor remedy whereby to obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence; and therefore it is not but a void commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and <hi>nudum pactum,</hi> as in 20. <hi>H.</hi> 6. In Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſs the Defendant pleads concord between them, That he ſhall pay 20. s. to the Plantiff at a day to come; it is not a bar, becauſe it is not ſatisfaction, nor recompence for it, becauſe he ſhall not have debt after the day, ſo 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4.19. in Trepſaſs upon 5. <hi>R.</hi> 2. Defendant pleads accord, That the Plantiff ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter, and have the land, and that the Defendant deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Plantiff all the Evidences concerning the land, and ſaid that the Plantiff had entred, and that he had delivered all the evidences unto him; It is no bar, for it intends the proper evidences of the Plantiff, and ſo no ſatisfaction of the wrong, but if it conveys to him Title to the evidence, then it is a good bar, ſo in 15. <hi>H.</hi> 6. in Treſpaſs againſt him by the Plantiff, he pleads, That they agree, that if the Defendant doth his endeavor for to agree them for a Treſpaſs by the Plantiff to <hi>S.</hi> That then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſaith, <hi>That he did his endeavor, ſo that they are accorded:</hi> it is no plea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no ſatisfaction; but if he ſaith, <hi>That he hath accorded them at his own coſts,</hi> it is a good bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gawdy</hi> the elder, for the Defendant. Arbitrement, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> which is Executory, 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4.51. <hi>Fitz. H.</hi> 4. <hi>Br.</hi> 3. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord is a good bar in Treſpaſs, becauſe he may have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:120227:7"/>debt at the day appointed for the payment of the ſumm agreed to be paid in recompence, and ſo the Treſpaſs is converted into another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Debt by the Arbitrators, which are judges of it: and ſo accord countervails ſatisfaction <hi>in facto,</hi> otherwiſe, it is of a concord executory, 6. <hi>H.</hi> 7.11. becauſe the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the concord confeſſeth a wrong, and it is not reaſon that the Plantiff in an action thereupon, ſhould be barred without ſatisfaction. And ſo ſhall the King be ſatisfied here. Alſo in concord, the wrong to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced precede the agreement, but here the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment precedes the wrong ſuppoſed, and cometh not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the wrong, as in concord, and therefore this caſe may not be reſembled to the caſe before of accord. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie</hi> at the beginning, which may be reduced to <hi>certaintie</hi> by matter <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> countervaileth <hi>certaintie, ab initio;</hi> as a man leaſeth all his Acres in D. paying for every one 12. <hi>d.</hi> it is a good reſervation, becauſe when the Acres are meaſured, the Rent ſhall be <hi>certain;</hi> ſo a gift of two Acres, of the one for Life, and of the other in Fee, by the <hi>Feoffment,</hi> of the one he ſhall have Fee in this <hi>ab initio:</hi> ſo <hi>Leſſee</hi> of <hi>white-acre,</hi> and <hi>Black-acre</hi> for life: the remainder of the one in Fee, to a ſtranger, and the <hi>Leſſor</hi> licences him for to cut Trees in <hi>White-acre:</hi> now he ſhall be adjudged to have the remainder of this Acre, <hi>ab initio;</hi> ſo the thing which at the commencement was <hi>incertain,</hi> is made <hi>certain.</hi> So in <hi>Wheelers</hi> caſe, 14. <hi>H.</hi> 8.17. So a Leaſe for ſo many years as I. S. ſhall name, is good, when he ſhall name the years. So 17. <hi>E.</hi> 4.1. <hi>A.</hi> bargains that <hi>B.</hi> ſhall have his wheat when he hath viewed it, if he pleaſe, paying 4. <hi>s.</hi> the Acre, good contract, if he paies when he carrieth it away, yet the quantity and ſumm incertain at the firſt, ſo here, when the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor hath weighed the woad. And therefore this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional agreement doth countervail an agreement <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:120227:7"/>at the beginning. And where acts ought to be performed ſtrictly, yet in divers caſes the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the intent, and not the words, good, for it countervaileth the performance of the words: So here. But performance of the words, and not of the intent, is not good: as <hi>Lit.</hi> fol. 182. of conditions upon a <hi>Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> for to give again to <hi>I. S.</hi> and his wife in ſpecial Tail, and they die, and the <hi>Feoffees</hi> make an eſtate to their iſſue, and the heirs of his father and mother, good, becauſe the intent of the condition is performed. So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 17. <hi>E.</hi> 4.3. Obligation upon condition to infeoff <hi>I. S.</hi> and he Leaſe for years, and Releaſe in Fee, it is a good performance, and a good <hi>Feoffment,</hi> and yet the words of a condition ſhall be performed as ſtrictly as a Statute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> the Kings Attorney. The mutual aſſent of the parties upon a thing incertain, is in Law but a vain communication before the certainty known, as in 37. <hi>H.</hi> 6.8. A man promiſes in marriage with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo much as <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall arbitrate. The party which ſhall marry his daughter ſhall not have it, if he marry her, until <hi>I. S.</hi> hath made his award, and appointed it; for before that it is reduced into certainty, it is but a vain communication. So in 20. <hi>H.</hi> 6. A man Leaſes to <hi>A.</hi> for ſo many years as <hi>B.</hi> ſhall name, he cannot enter into the land, before that <hi>B.</hi> hath named the number of years; And the witneſs of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, which ſaith, That he found ſuerties, and hath not ſhewed who, or what, as he ought, is wanting both in the name and ability of the ſureties, which the Court ought to adjudge of, as in 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4.40. A man that was bound to ſhew a ſufficient diſcharge of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, pleaded that he had offered to ſhew it to him, and he refuſed to ſee it, and held no good plea. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the Statute in iſſue ſhall be intended general; <hi>viz.</hi> certain, and ſpecial; <hi>viz.</hi> incertain in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:120227:8"/>evidence proves not the iſſue, neither is it purſuant to the iſſue; as in 31. <hi>H.</hi> 6. Upon <hi>non eſt factum</hi> pleaded in debt, witneſſes ſay, That it was delivered at another place then it did bear date, whereupon the Defendant demurred, and the Plantiff was barred, becauſe this proved not it to be his Deed; for the delivery ſhall be intended where it was dated, and the witneſſes prove the contrary, and ſo the evidence warrants not the iſſue; ſo in 18. <hi>H.</hi> 6.16. One deed of Leaſe for life without Livery given in evidence, ſhall not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon Free-hold, pleaded the iſſue; ſo in 14. <hi>E.</hi> 3. Upon traverſe of a gift in Tail, the witneſſes prove that another made the gift, and awarded that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ſhould be barred, ſo if he had pleaded the general agreement in bar, and ſpecial in the rejoinder, it is a departure; as in 6. <hi>H.</hi> 7.8. In Treſpaſs the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant pleaded a deſcent to him, and the Plaintiff ſaid, That after the Defendant infeoffed him; and the Denfendant ſaid, That it was upon condition, and for breach thereof he entred; this is a departure from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the Bar, for it is a new matter. For the ſame reaſon a ſpecial agreement in evidence ſhall not maintain the general iſſue, one witneſs is not enough, nor one Juror, for to try an iſſue, if more were warned by the Sheriff: 8. <hi>E.</hi> 3.50. So here the Defendant had but one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which proves for him, which is not ſufficient, and ſo judgement ſhall be given for the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atkins</hi> for the Defendant. A witneſs produced to prove a thing, if he ſaith. That he knoweth nothing of the matter, his depoſition is void; ſo, if he depoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, as to ſay no more was not entred then ſo much, and if no witneſs, the knowing of the Jurors aid not the tryal of the matter; and a Verdict given contrary to the teſtimony of witneſſes, good. It is not needfull to aver that, which of neceſſity muſt be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as that the King hath a Beam there; ſpecial agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:120227:8"/>is an agreement, as a Feoffment upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is a Feoffment, and ſo this word <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> includes every agreement, by which the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence well maintains the iſſue. The Statute ſpeaks not of ſurety, and peradventure intends it not, and therefore in vain to ſpeak of it; and therefore it may be he hath not anſwered to this exception. Agreement in our Law is threefold, <hi>viz.</hi> Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the beginning of it, with payment intended, by the Statute of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. which ſaith, <hi>That goods bought by fore-ſtallers, are forfeited to the King,</hi> if the buyer had made agreement with the ſeller; ſuch agreement is not meant in our caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then, the Statute ſhould not be intended in the disjunctive; for then the firſt, and the ſecond clauſe ſhould be all one: but the word, <hi>[Or]</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns the clauſes. Agreement to an act made by another, as in 20. <hi>E.</hi> 4.9. To a diſſeiſin to his uſe, maketh him a diſſeiſor from the beginning: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> ſo the party raviſhed, to agree to the raviſher, is an agreement executed here becauſe nothing is to be done afterwards, and agreement here may not be an executory agreement, becauſe the performance ſhall be afterwards, yet both parties accord at one time before, <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. intends ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſpeaks of payment, or agreement for firſt fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and common uſage to pay after, upon obligation made before, proves this, which intends agreement executory; and here agreement is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended executory; becauſe it is not the firſt, nor the ſecond; and an agreement executory, is <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex,</hi> the one certain at the beginning, as this of firſt fruits; the other by matter <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> upon certainty to be known, as here; and ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment executory, the Statute will warrant; for no Law will puniſh him, in whom there is no default,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:120227:9"/>and where he cannot prevent the miſchance by no poſſibility, for the neceſſity of the matter, and for that inevitable chance ſhall not prejudice any: 20. <hi>H.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Fineus:</hi> A man by the Common Law may kill another in his own defence, or as a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, for the neceſſary ſafeguard of his life, and the Tryal of right; ſo notwithſtanding the cuſtom of the Realm, new <hi>Natura brevium,</hi> 94. <hi>b.</hi> If ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the King ſteal of Gueſts, the Hoaſtler is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> diſcharged, becauſe he cannot reſiſt. So if the ſhip were on fire, the caſting of the goods on the land without payment, or agreement for the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſhall excuſe the Defendant; ſo here the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Tempeſt, doth excuſe the vigor of the Statute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanders,</hi> the Kings Serjeant. Notwitſtanding that an agreement conditional is included in the words of the Statute, <hi>viz.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend not for to diſcharge Bullion, but great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies upon Wooll after 3. years; ſo that the mind &amp; intent of the makers ſhall expound the general, and doubtfull words of Star and abridge the generalty of them: ſo here it ſhall be intended an agreement certain. Alſo becauſe the Commons pray the King, That he will be pleaſed to accept of their Grant, for that the words of the Statute, which is their Grant, ſhall be taken more beneficial for the King, and moſt ſtrong againſt the Grantors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principle of the Common Law, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> caſe of a common perſon. So the Statute of <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gativa Regis,</hi> 17. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Raſtal, wards</hi> 13. is the Grant of the Commons to the King, which ſaith, The King ſhall have the cuſtody of all the Lands of ſuch which hold of him by <hi>Knights ſervice in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite,</hi> whereof the Tenants were ſeized in their Demeaſne, as of Fee at the day of their death, of whomſoever they hold alſo by like <hi>Knights Service,</hi> and notwithſtanding that <hi>Fee</hi> is commonly taken to be <hi>Fee-Simple,</hi> yet the King ſhall have of <hi>Tail</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhall be conſtrued moſt ſtrongly for the K. where it hath two intendments. Agreements upon which the Common Law giveth no remedy, are void, and not good; as in 19. <hi>H.</hi> 6.36. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an information for the forging of falſe Deeds, the Defendant pleads Arbitrement made, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Plaintiff ſhall not farther proſecute his Writ againſt the Defendant; and ſaith alſo, That the Defendant ſhall be <hi>non-ſuited</hi> in the Aſſize; This is no Plea, becauſe <hi>non-ſuited</hi> founds not in ſatisfaction, and cannot compell him to be <hi>non-ſuited:</hi> for the award is not good, if it be not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted wholly, or the thing awarded may be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:120227:10"/>by action; and therefore in 6. <hi>H.</hi> 7.10. In Treſpaſs, to ſay, That he hath paid money, but he hath not made his windows, which the Heir may compel him to do, for the concord is intire, but wants execution in all; and indeed before action brought, is not good, then it is performed, yet not immediately, and therefore it was held no Plea. So in 27. <hi>aſſ. pl.</hi> 5. A Baily known pledge the Ox of his Maſter for Wheat, and if he pays not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhall keep the Ox alwaies. This ſhall bind the Maſter, becauſe the wheat cometh to his uſe, otherwiſe not, becauſe he had no recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. So in 17. <hi>E.</hi> 4.1. In Treſpaſs for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of wheat, the Defendant pleads, That the Plaintiff ſold it, if he liked it upon view, he ſhould have it, paying 40. d. and afterwards he ſaw it, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it, and took it; this is no good juſtification, becauſe he doth not alleadge payment, ſo here. So contracts conditional are good, when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but before performance, they are onely communications.</p>

                  <hi>Brook,</hi> Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> for the Defendant. Where matters are to be tryed in the Civil Law, there ought to be two witneſſes, here not neceſſary; For where tryal is by twelve men, becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt may give a preciſe Verdict, where there is no Teſtimony, or Verdict, or Evidence, or Evidence be contrary to the Witneſſes, as in 14. <hi>H.</hi> 7.2. <hi>the Inqueſt</hi> acquit one indicted of murther; he is arrained, and acquit; <hi>the Jury</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>who killed him?</hi> although they have no witneſſes, and ſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are not neceſſary, but where the matter is to be tryed by witneſſes onely; for if the witneſſes were ſo neceſſary, then it would enſue, That the Jurors ſhould not give their Verdict contrary to the witneſſes, where the Law is meerly contrary; for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:120227:10"/>when witneſſes for tryal of the Fact joyn with the Jury, if they cannot agree with the Jurors, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the 12. ſhall be taken, and the witneſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; wherefore this point is clear enough. And as to this which hath been ſaid by <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> That the depoſition of <hi>Da.</hi> will make againſt us; for that he ſaith, That <hi>S.</hi> ſhewed to him, that the entry was not made for more then 2000 Kintals: Sir, this ſaying is nothing to the purpoſe, for if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay ſomething to prove the iſſue, in which he cometh to depoſe, then it is neither with us, nor againſt us, but it is of the ſame effect in Law, as if he had ſaid nothing, or that he knew not of the matter; and ſo this point is alſo clear enough. And as to that which hath been moved alſo by Mr. <hi>Attorney;</hi> That he ought to ſhew what rate in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: Sir, this needs not here, becauſe it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Statute, 12. d. of every 20. s. and of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Statutes every one ſhall take notice. And he argued and ſaid; That the agreement here ſhall be good, and is within the intent of the Statute; for in many Caſes, Gifts, and Grants made, will not be certain at the beginning, and yet ſhall be good, for that there is a mean to reduce them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to certainty, and yet the nature of Gifts, and Grants is to be executed preſently, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gift is an agreement between the parties, and ſo is every Grant; and then if Gifts and Grants, (which are alſo agreements, and the nature of which is to be executed properly at the time of the making of them,) it ſhall be good, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are incertain at the beginning <hi>à fortiori.</hi> Agreements Executory of things ſhall be good, where they are incertain at the firſt, and to prove that ſuch Gifts, and Grants ſhall be good, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their incertainty at the firſt, there
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:120227:11"/>are many Caſeſ and therefore if the King at this day grant over certain Lands, which have come to his hands before, and Grant over to the Grantee ſuch Liberties, Priviledges, and Juriſdictions, howbeit that the King knoweth not the certainty of the Liberties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the Grant is good. So in 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6.27. The King grants to the Dutches of <hi>York</hi> an Iſland, with all Iſſues and Amerciaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there it is holden that the grant is good, yet the King knew not what Iſſues, or what Americiaments ſhall be afterwards forfeited; but for that, that when they ſhall be forfeit, they will be certainly known, and ſo hath a means to know the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them; this is the cauſe that the Grant ſhall be good. And ſo in 5. <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>the King</hi> Granted to one called <hi>Garter,</hi> the Office of <hi>the King of Heralds,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> 
                  <hi>cum ſeodis &amp; proſicuis ah antiquo,</hi> &amp;c. There this Grant purports a certainty of the Fees, and Profits belonging to it, and therefore good. And ſo in 30. <hi>H.</hi> 6. The King Grants all ſuch Lands as came to him by Attainder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is good, although it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends no certainty. And ſo if the King will pardon all Riots, <hi>Pardon is good;</hi> howbeit, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends no certainty. 21. <hi>H.</hi> 6.43. A Parſon grants to me his Tythe-wooll the next year, or perquiſites of his Court, the Grants are good. So <hi>Perkins</hi> 17. Feoffment of two Acres, to hold the one for life, the other in Fee, without ſaying he ſhall have Fee; if he loſe both by default, he may have <hi>Quod ei deforceat</hi> for the one, and Writ of right for the other. So if one grant a rent charge to another, the Grantee may avow, or have a Writ of annuity. So in 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4.36. <hi>per. Litt.</hi> Grant 20. s. or a garment, good, becauſe certain by the will of the Grantor. So a Leaſe for ſo many years as <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall name, is good. So <hi>Perkins</hi> Fol. 17. If I have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:120227:11"/>a black and white Horſes, and I give one of them to <hi>I. S.</hi> this gift is good, notwithſtanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty by the election of the Donee. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not concluded who ſhall weigh, and when, yet it is good, becauſe there is an Officer in every Port which keeps a Beam, and ought to weigh. And although the Statute do ſpeak of an agreement certain, yet Law, the reaſon aſwaies exempts ſomething out of the prohibition of the words of Statutes, as 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7.2. by <hi>Keble,</hi> a Priſoner which breaketh Priſon, by the words of the Statute is a Felon; but if he break it when it is on fire, not. So 14. <hi>H.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Stamford,</hi> 25. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. Jurors ſevered by a great Tempeſt, ſhall not be Amerced, and their Verdict good. So <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. Gives not to a Fem Covert <hi>Receipt,</hi> but where the wife is ready to anſwer, yet the wife received by prayer in aid, 20. <hi>H.</hi> 6.48. and there ſhe is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, where ſhe is not ready to anſwer, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhe ſhall looſe <hi>the recompence</hi> by <hi>warrantie.</hi> So <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. ſay, That <hi>Dones</hi> ſhall not alien; yet 5. <hi>E.</hi> 2. is intended of their Iſſues, ſo here, for to avoid miſchiefs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Harris</hi> the Kings Serjeant, to the contrary. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> he argued as the Kings Attorney did, that is to ſay, That the evidence which proves the agreement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, warrants not the iſſue, which ſhall be intended a general agreement; as if the Deren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Treſpaſs plead not guilty, and give a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in evidence, or in <hi>formedon in diſcendre,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a gift in free marriage: if the gift is traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and a Deed is ſhewed of the gift in free Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. <hi>the Remainder</hi> over in Fee, or upon traverſe of a Leaſe for years, alleadged without Deed, and the Deed is ſhewed in evidence, this evidence warrants not the iſſue: So here an agreement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:120227:12"/>maintains not the general agreement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in iſſue; the Collector could not agree o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then for landing, becauſe the Statute will; as if a Baily pay the debts of his Maſter, he ſhall not be allowed for this in his accompt, without ſpecialty; but if he pay Quit-Rents, iſſuing out of the Land, he ſhall be allowed for this, for that the payment of this belongeth to his Office. And ſo if the Collector accept another Agreement then is intended by the Statute, this ſhall not help the party; and ſaid, that agreement upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ought to be performed before it be pleaded; as if I give all the money in my purſe to <hi>I. S.</hi> he cannot have his action for it, except that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge the certainty of it; So here: wherefore judgement ſhall be given for the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pollard,</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant. An agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon condition, is an agreement, as a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon condition, is a Feoffment, and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in words of the iſſue, (that is to ſay in this word <hi>Agreement,</hi> which contains every agreement. So 36. <hi>H.</hi> 6.2. In debt upon a Regogniſance, and the Defendant ſaith, That there is no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſance, whereupon they were at iſſue, and at the day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Recogniſance with condition was certified, &amp; held good, and that he had not failed of the Record, becauſe a Recogniſance upon condition is held to be a Recogniſance. So here, the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment general was put in iſſue, the which ſhall be intended the more common agreement, and this is the general agreement, and the evidence given by <hi>W.</hi> proves a ſpecial agreement, <hi>viz.</hi> an agreement upon condition, which is other then the agreement tendred by the iſſue; &amp; therefore the Demurrer ſhall be adjudged for the King, and Informer. Sir, as to this I anſwer; That by the arguments made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:120227:12"/>nothing hath been put in iſſue, but if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree according to the Statute; ſo here: admitting that the agreement general had been in iſſue, but the eſpecial is: The eſpecial matter, <hi>viz.</hi> Tempeſt, <hi>&amp; ſuper hoc agreavit,</hi> are in the affirmative, and may ſtand together; and therefore both remain as one entire matter, and ſubſtance of the iſſue. As if the Tenant pleads ſpecial Baſtardy againſt the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Plaintiff, <hi>in mort D'anceſter,</hi> and alleadge this incertain, as he ought, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Plaintiff was ingendred between <hi>I.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> and born before mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, &amp; then they marry and conclude as he ought, and ſo Baſtard; This concluſion hath not avoided the ſpecial matter before, for if ſo, then it ſhould be Baſtard generally, and triable by the Biſhop, and then ſhall be by him certified <hi>Mulier,</hi> becauſe ſuch is a <hi>mulier</hi> in the law ſpiritual, but ſhal be tried here by Aſſize; and therefore the ſpecial matter remains, and the iſſue is taken thereupon. So 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7.5. by <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> One counts of a gift <hi>in formedon,</hi> and being demandant, maintains it by recovery in value, by reaſon of a Warranty; and ſo gave, the Tenant ought not to traverſe <hi>the concluſion, viz.</hi> as he ſhould do if he had avoided the ſpecial matter before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is matter in fact, triable by the Countrey, but he ought to anſwer to the recovery, triable by Record, which proves, That the ſpecial matter before the concluſion ſhall remain. So 32. <hi>H.</hi> 6.14. by <hi>Litl.</hi> If the Plaintiff in Aſſize makes to himſelf a Title, and concludes, and ſo he was ſeiſed until by the Defendant diſſeiſed; now if this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath avoided the eſpecial matter before, then it enſueth that the Defendant cannot anſwer to the Title; but the Law is, That he ought to anſwer to the Title, and traverſe it; by which it is proved, that the concluſion hath not avoided the eſpeciall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:120227:13"/>matter before; and in all theſe caſes, the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the concluſion, and the concluſion, are in the Affirmative; as in Debt, the Defendant pleads payment, and ſo ows nothing; and in Treſpaſs the Defendant pleads a gift of the goods, and ſo not guilty: when it is agreed between any, That a principal thing ſhall be done or had, and before that this may be done or had, there is another thing firſt to be done, which is not certainly agreed who ſhall do the other thing; the Law appoints him which hath the moſt skill, to do the ſaid other thing. So 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4.4. One is bound to make the great Bell of <hi>M.</hi> tunable with the other Bels; there in that caſe to ſay in Debt by Obligation, That the Bell was not weighed, judgement if action, is no Plea, becauſe in conſtruction of the Law he ſhall weigh it, for it belongeth to his Office. So a Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor bound to make a gown, ſhall ſhape the cloth: So here the Collector in behalf of the King, ſhall have the Subſidie which is the principal thing; and therefore he ſhall weigh, for it belongeth to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to try the certainty, for without certainty the King may not be ſatisfied. And in Treſpaſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he juſtiſies the neceſſary circumſtance and mean, or hath Title to the principal thing; as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> 2. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Fitz. Bar.</hi> 333. and <hi>Perkins, fol.</hi> 23. He may cut and carry trees granted to him, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it, although the graſs is ſpoiled by it. So one may take Fiſhes in a Pond with Nets, and juſtifie it, but if he digg a Trench to drain out the water, not. A Collector may weigh when he pleaſes; for where one ſhall have benefit upon the firſt act to be done by him, and no time is limited when he ſhall do it; the Law ſaith, That it ſhall be done at his pleaſure: So the Mortgager ſhall pay when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, when no time is limited; ſo one may marry the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:120227:13"/>daughter of <hi>A.</hi> when he pleaſeth, if no time be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited: ſo in the principal caſe, for as much as payment ſhall be made to the Collector upon the weighing, and no time is limited for the weighing, the Law refers the time of it to the will of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, and ſo the agreement is good and perfect. 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7.11. The Sheriff takes <hi>A.</hi> by <hi>Capias,</hi> now he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> doth well, but if he return <hi>non eſt inventus,</hi> then he ſhall be a Treſpaſſor <hi>ab initio;</hi> but here the not weighing, becauſe the King refers this to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector in the behalf of the King, in his default the agreement ſhall not be made void <hi>ab initio,</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Defendant, which before was good, notwithſtanding that the agreement ſpecial is an agreement, as <hi>Sanders</hi> confeſſeth; yet it ſhall be conſtrued beſt, <hi>viz.</hi> general for the King, as he urged. The rules of the Common Law in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Statutes, prohibite this; for Statutes Penal ſhall be taken and reſtrained to their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words, favourably, and to the benefit, and not prejudice of him againſt whom the pain is inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhall not extend farther then the words, as <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 40. ſaith, where the husband aliens the land of his wife, <hi>quod ſecta mulieris non differatur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>per minorem aetatem heraedis qui warrantizare debet,</hi> and ſaith not the Heir of the husband, nor of a ſtranger; yet 18. <hi>E.</hi> 4.16. and 17. <hi>E.</hi> 4.59. <hi>&amp; poſtea</hi> 47. the patol Demur, <hi>in cui in vita per nonage</hi> of the ſecond vouchee, becauſe he was not heir to the husband, and ſo becauſe penal, <hi>here in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of him it is reſtrained</hi> to the heir of the husband onely: So by <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. an accomptant found in arrearages, ſhall be impriſoned by Auditors, and ſaith not when, in 27. <hi>H.</hi> 6 8. In debt for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages of accompt, it is adjudged, That if the Auditors do not commit the accomptant to priſon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:120227:14"/>preſently after the accompt; and therefore the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of time is reſtrained to a particularity, by the rule of the Common Law in conſtruction of Statutes, and alſo by the intent of the makers; for if the ſcope and end of the matter is ſatisfied, all the matter, and intent of the matter is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the ſcope of the Statute here was, That the King ſhall have the Subſidie, and the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here ſufficeth for that, becauſe it authorizeth the King to weigh Woad by the Collector when he pleaſeth, and then the King hath Title of Action and ſo the ſurety of the King thereby is referred to will. Alſo ſuch agreement hath been allowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame words of former Statutes for Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Alſo if the Statute had expreſſed the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in certain, yet agreement uncertain ſhould have been good here, and out of the penalty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the infringing of the words of the Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the infringing of the intent of the Law; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome accidents the law priviledges ſome things done againſt the words of the Law, of the nature of the Law of this Realm, and of other Realms, and the Law of God: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, for to avoid greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies. Secondly, for neceſſity. Thirdly, by compulſion. Fourthly, by involuntary igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Firſt for the avoiding of greater inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies; as 22. <hi>aſſ. pl.</hi> 6. where a man of <hi>non ſane memory,</hi> and in his rage did great hurt; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man and his parents took him, bound him, and beat him with rods; and here it is holden that they might juſtifie this in avoidance of greater da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, being of <hi>non ſane memory;</hi> and yet the Law of nature, and of the Realm prohibites battery, but this particular caſe for the avoiding of greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, hath one exception, and ſpecial priviledge. So 1. <hi>H.</hi> 6.9. The Lord (contrary to the Statute of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:120227:14"/>
                  <hi>Marlebridge,</hi>) may lead the Diſtreſs from the Land into another County where the Mannor is; for it ſhould be prejudicial to the Lord, if he ſhould not carry the diſtreſs to his Manor. Amongſt the Romans they had a Law, That every one which ſhould ſcale the walls in the night, ſhould be condemned to death; and one in the night did ſcale the walls in the time of War, to diſcry enemies to the Romans, and he by the judgement of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate was not onely diſcharged, but had a reward therefore; ſo ſuch interpreting of Laws, is a temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the rigor of the Law. Secondly; <hi>neceſſitas non habet legem;</hi> and therefore it is a good excuſe in every Law, as 38. <hi>H.</hi> 6.11. Increaſing of water excuſeth a default in a <hi>precipe quod reddat,</hi> becauſe he could not appear without danger of death; yet the Law abhors every default, becauſe it is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Court: So <hi>David</hi> did eat bread for neceſſity, although prohibited by the Law of God. Thirdly; compulſion excuſes in Law, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of an obligation made by dares: So if the arm of any man is drawn by compulſion, and a weapon in his hand kill another, this ſhall not be Felony, nor he damnified, becauſe he did it by compulſion. Fourthly; involuntary ignorance doth excuſe: as 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Kell. fol.</hi> 268. An infant killeth another, it is not Felony, becauſe he hath not diſcretion, and it ſhall be imputed to his ignorance, which is involuntary by compulſion of nature; &amp; ſo no default in him. So <hi>Fitz. Nat. br.</hi> 202. <hi>b.</hi> if one of <hi>non ſane memory</hi> kill another becauſe his ignorance by compulſion, <hi>viz.</hi> the hand of God, and ſuch other things done by ignorance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not to be reſiſted, and this involuntary igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is cauſe of the Act; and therefore he which kills another by involuntary ignorance, <hi>As by th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. For that the averment of his continual reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is ſurpluſage; and therefore the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thereof <hi>nil refert,</hi> by <hi>Harris, Hinde,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. It is not a condition compulſary, but a thing elegible, at the diſcretion of the Defendant, (by <hi>Montague</hi>) and then his entry is not material, but at his pleaſure.</p>

               <p n="4">4. For that it is pleaded by way of Bar, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain to a common intent, it ſufficeth, and it ſhall be intended that he entred immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Remainder happened; but by <hi>Hales</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, this common intent ought to be of a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſumption, and not indifferent.</p>

                  <hi>Pollard,</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff. Except that the Form of the Plea is ſufficient. 1, Becauſe he doth not aver his continual reſidence after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder happened, but after his entry, which may happen to be long time after, and ſo although that he hath performed the words of the condition, which hath not ſatisfied the intent thereof, yet he hath not performed the condition, becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was, That he ſhould have all the Mannor. So 21. <hi>H.</hi> 6.10. A man is bound that his Feoffees of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> ſhould grant a Rent of 40. s. to the Plaintiff. He had three Feoffees, and two of them grant the ſaid Rent to him, and there all the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſaid, That it ſhall be intended all the Feoffees; ſo that alwaies the intent of the condition ought to be as well performed, as the words of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and here the intent of the condition appears to be, That Hoſpitality ſhall be kept upon the Grange continually from the beginning to the end of the Term, which is the death of the Husband and the Wife; and here he hath not ſhewed that he entred within as ſhort time as he conveniently could after the death of the Husband and Wife; and therefore becauſe he hath not ſhewed and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this, he hath not ſhewed the performance of the condition, and therefore his plea is not good: For in all caſes where the time is iſſuable, he ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſhew it certainly, and therefore in 32. <hi>H.</hi> 6. it is held, That if a man plead a Leaſe for years made to him, that he ought to ſhew what day the Leaſe was made, becauſe it is iſſuable. So in 33. <hi>H.</hi> 6.44. In debt by an Executor the Defendant ſaith, That the Teſtator made the Plaintiff, and one <hi>R.</hi> his Executors at <hi>L.</hi> the which <hi>R.</hi> is alive and not named, judgement of the Writ, and the Plaintiff confeſſing it, ſaith, That after this time laſt aſſigned
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:120227:16"/>by the Plaintiff, that the Teſtator made the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff his ſole Executor in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſaith, That after this time laſt aſſigned by the Plaintiff, that the Teſtator made the Plaintiff and <hi>R.</hi> his Executors after this time, and the Plea of the Defendant was not held good, for that the day on which the Plaintiff, and <hi>R.</hi> were made Executors, is uncertain. So 3. <hi>H.</hi> 6.33. In Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the Defendant pleads in Bar the day of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Plaintiff, who traverſeth the Bar, and the Defendant enforced to ſhew the day certain.<note place="margin">Matter in Law.</note> As to the matter in Law, it ſeemeth to him that the Remainder is void, becauſe it ought alwaies to be limited to take its effect after the partricular eſtate ended, and not during the particular eſtate; for if it be limited, and appointed to take its effect, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the particular eſtate, then it ſhall be utterly void. As if <hi>A.</hi> Leaſes to <hi>B.</hi> for life, the Remainder for life; and if <hi>B.</hi> dies, that it ſhall remain over to a ſtranger in Fee, this Remainder is void, for that it is appointed to take effect immediately after the firſt eſtate for life ended; for if the Remainder in Fee ſhould commence, then it ſhall avoid the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder for life; ſo if a Leaſe be made to two, the Remainder over in Fee after the death of the firſt of them; this Remainder is void, becauſe the Survivor ſhall have the Land. So in the principal caſe it is given to the Baron and Fem for their lives, the Remainder to the eldeſt ſon for life upon conditon, That if the eldeſt die, living hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife, that then it ſhall remain to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant for life, which cannot be; for the firſt eſtate at this time continues, and if the Remainder ſhall be good, it drowns the eſtate of husband and wife, and therefore the Remainder void, and alſo for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> that it is limited to commence upon condition,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:120227:17"/>which enures alwaies in privity; therefore if a leaſe for life be made, rendring rent, and upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That if the Rent be arear, that then it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to a ſtranger in Fee; if the Rent be arear, and not paid, the remainder is void; for the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which commence upon condition, is not good, otherwiſe it is, if an eſtate be made for life upon condition, That if the Tenant for Life dies, it ſhall remain over, this Remainder is good, becauſe that it commenceth upon the Determination of the I ſtate, the which is certain; and therefore no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, becauſe conditions are alwaies incertain, and may be performed or broken; and as our Law is, for to know the time certain when the things paſs from one to another, and namely Free-hold, becauſe the Law hath it in greater eſtimation then other things, and ſo to prevent contention, hath ordained Ceremonies to be uſed, as in every Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Livery, and in every Grant, Reverſion, or Rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Attornment ſhall be made, the which are points certain containing time, and by them Eſtates paſs.<note place="margin">Rules to know when Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are good.</note> The Law hath appointed that every Remainder ſhall have three things by the matters aforeſaid, as Notes and Rules certain for to diſcern when good. The firſt is an Eſtate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, made at the ſame time that the remainder Commences, and that the particular Eſtate conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue when the Remainder veſts, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder be from the Donor at the time of Livery, and if any of the ſaid three things fail the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is void. And therefore for the firſt point, if the Leſſor confirm the ſtate of his Tenant for years, the Remainder in Fee; this Remainder is vold, for that the Eſtate for years was made before the Remainder. So if a Leſſor diſſeiſe his Tenant for Life, and after makes a new Leaſe to him for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:120227:17"/>Life the remainder in Fee; this Remainder is void becauſe it is a Remitter to his Eſtate. So an Eſtate precedent was not made at the time of the remainder, and therefore the Remainder is void. So the Heir endows his Mother Remainder in Fee, by reaſon of Relation, and ſo the precedent Eſtates are made before the Remainder appointed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the particular Eſtate continue when the remainder veſts, as 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7.12. <hi>per Frowick,</hi> Leaſe for Life upon Condition, That if he doth not ſuch an Act, that his Eſtate ſhall ceaſe, and that then the Remainder over is void, becauſe the Eſtate precedent is determined before the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der appointed, and the Remainder muſt veſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the particular Eſtate. Thirdly, becauſe the Remainder paſſes from the Leſſor at the time of the delivery, as <hi>Hales, Hinde,</hi> and <hi>Montague</hi> ſay, and as it is proved by the Caſes before cited. So <hi>Perkins,</hi> 12. and 19. Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> in Life, paſſes from the Leſſor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, although it veſts not preſently; but here the Remainder paſſeth not preſently, becauſe the Condition precedes the Remainder, as 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. if <hi>A.</hi> Grant to <hi>B.</hi> That when he is promoted to a Benefice, or do ſuch an Act, he ſhall have an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity; there he ſhall ſhew his Promotion, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his Annuity, becauſe it is a Condition precedent, and to him which maketh the Grant; but if he Grants an Annuity until he be promoted, there he ſhall not ſhew it, becauſe the Promotion is ſubſequent to the Annuity, and will defeat the Annuity; and therefore it ſhall be ſhewed by the other party, which is contray. So 7. <hi>E.</hi> 3.10. A <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Leſſee for eight years, rendring 10. s. yearly, and if he holdeth over to him and his heirs, an action of Debt is maintainable during the Term, for the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120227:18"/>Rent is a Chattle, becauſe the Fee paſſeth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, for that the Condition precedes the Fee. So 6. <hi>R.</hi> 2. a Leaſe to two for years upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That if the Leſſee aliens within the Term, or die, he ſhall have Fee: it is holden that the Fee paſſeth not preſently, becauſe the Condition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes it; which Caſes prove, That the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paſſes not out of the Leſſor at the time of the Livery, albeit that the Condition precede the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder; and proves alſo, That the Remainder Commenceth upon Condition; and proves alſo, That the Remainder is appointed to begin after the Commencement of the particular Eſtate, the which is contrary to the grounds of Law, and therefore, and for the ſaid other cauſes, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſhall be void. And ſo for the inſufficiencie of the matter of the Bar, and Form alſo, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ſhall recover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cook,</hi> Serjeant to the contrary. As to the two Exceptions which have been moved, That the Plea is not good, becauſe he ſhews not that he hath been reſiant (after the deaths of the Husband and Wife) alwaies, nor what day he entred. Sir, I take it, That it ſhall be taken, that he entred immediately after the death of the Husband and Wife, for the Defendant hath pleaded by way of Bar, and if the Bar hath matter of ſubſtance, and is good to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intent, it ſufficeth, although it be not good to every ſpecial intent; and therefore in the Caſe of 33. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 24. where the Defendant pleads, That the Teſtator made the Plaintiff, and one <hi>R.</hi> his Executor, Judgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Plea was good, without ſhewing that he was made after that the Plaintiff was made ſole Executor, becauſe it ſhall be intended after. So 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 15. by <hi>Keble;</hi> in Treſpas the Defendant pleads his Free-hold good;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:120227:18"/>becauſe good by Common intendment; yet the Plaintiff might have an Eſtate for years, and it may ſtand with his Bar, and by which he may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the default, but ſuch ſpecial matter will not be intended. So 6. <hi>E.</hi> 4.1. in Debt upon an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation the Defendant ſaith, That he hath done ſuch things as was contained in the Indenture, and at Iſſue, and found for the Plaintiff, and ſpoken to in Arreſt of Judgement, becauſe the Defendant ſaid not that the two Covenants were all, and ſo had not alleadged the performance of all, but held good, becauſe by Common intent there ſhall not be intended more then two Covenants, if the Plaintiff ſhew not the contrary. So 3. <hi>H.</hi> 6.4. in Formedon he gave not <hi>prima facie,</hi> a good Bar, becauſe it intends a general gift; and yet it may be, That the Land was recovered in value, and then the Plea is not apt, for other Land was given. So 3. <hi>H.</hi> 6.3. In Debt, nothing in their hands pleaded by Executors, good; yet it may be that other goods firſt, not the Teſtators, at the day of his death, are come to their hands in place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of other goods. So 21. <hi>H.</hi> 6.17. In Aſſiſe the Defendant was in by diſcent, where he had a mean Title, which tolled the Aſſiſe of the other, &amp; ſhall not be void by the ſaid recovery; but this ſhall not be intended without ſhewing; ſo diſcent and entry in Bar, good; yet it may be that a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger abated, and dyed ſeiſed, and the Heir could not enter; but if ſhall not be intended without ſhewing ſpecially; but when a thing Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in reſpect of the time, then the certainty of the time ſhall be ſhewed, <hi>fol.</hi> 24.27.33. as 20. <hi>H.</hi> 7.12. by <hi>Rede.</hi> A Servant, which demanded 20. s. Sallary for his ſervice by the year, ought to ſhew the expiration of the year, becauſe the Action is given
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:120227:19"/>in reſpect of the year paſt, and the time is parcell of the cauſe of the Demand, and precedes the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but here the time purſues the Remainder, and is not cauſe of the Remainder; and therefore we ought to ſhew it ſo certainly, as where time gains a thing, for here it goeth in defeaſance of the thing; and therefore the Bar is good, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſaid two Exceptions; beſides, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me the Remainder is good. For firſt, he hath an Eſtate here, upon which the Remainder may be grounded; &amp; here the remainder is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereupon, but the cauſe wherefore the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall not be good, is alleadged in two great points, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Fee paſſeth not preſently forth of the Leſſor, and alſo for that the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cannot paſs upon Condition. And it ſeems to me, That the Remainder paſſeth out of the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor preſently, howbeit that it veſts not preſently, as in <hi>Litl.</hi> 81. A Leaſe for five years, if he pay within the firſt two, that then he ſhall have Fee, the Fee paſſeth out of the Leſſor preſently; ſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the right Heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> in life; and a Remainder may Commence upon Condition, as a Leaſe for life upon Condition, That <hi>I. S.</hi> Marry my Daughter during the ſtate for Life, which ſhall remain to him, is good, becauſe he hath an Eſtate upon which it may be grounded. So 34. <hi>E.</hi> 3. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe for Life upon Condition, That if the Heir to whom the Reverſion diſcends, diſturbs Tenant for Life, or his Executors of their Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That then the Land ſhall remain to the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Deviſor, and to her Heirs, and dyeth: Tenant for Life dyeth, the Son of the Daughter brings his Formedon againſt the Heir, becauſe he diſturbs the Tenant, and alſo the Executors of the Tenant traverſe it, and at iſſue, and upon this iſſue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:120227:19"/>is joyned, which ſhould not have been ſo, if the Remainder had not been good. Alſo if Aſſent, as 18. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 12. by <hi>Catesby, ante</hi> 8. <hi>poſt</hi> 31. to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſen made before to anothers uſe, may Traverſe the Free-hold from one to another, <hi>à fortiori</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition may, namely where the Franck-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement precedes, to which a Condition may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morgan, Serjeant</hi> for the Plaintiff. The Plea is not good, becauſe it doth not ſhew the day in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, of the death of <hi>W.</hi> nor of the Husband and Wife, but he argued not this. Alſo it is not good, becauſe he ſhewed not the day of the entry for a Bar good to a Common intent, is not good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe parcel of the Subſtance is left out, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Durante termino,</hi> is for all the Term; for that the time, which is parcel of the Subſtance of the Bar, ought to be ſhewed as the Obligee infeoffees fee; another before <hi>M.</hi> he muſt ſhew in certain what day he did infeoff him. So 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7.3. the Lord which Leaſeth within the year, entred for Mortmain, for otherwiſe it ſhall not be intended for to enter within the year, if he doth not ſet it forth; but the Bar is good where ſuch things are limited, becauſe that by ſpecial, and not by general intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are omitted; as a Feoffment in Bar is good to a Common intent, yet it may be, That the Feoffor was within age, or in priſon, but ſuch ſpecial things ſhall not be intended by the Law, but ſhall be ſhewed. As to the matter, there are principally two things, upon which Arguments may be made, <hi>viz.</hi> Maxims, and Reaſons, the Mother of all Laws; and the Maxims are the Foundations of the Law, and Concluſions of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therefore are holden as firm Principles, and Authorities of themſelves. One is, a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:120227:20"/>ſhal not be limitted, except it be to a perſon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable at the time, as to a <hi>Monk</hi> profeſt, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is deraigned, &amp; after this, the Tenant for life dies, the Leſſee for life ſhal not have the remainder, becauſe he was not a perſon able at the time of the remainder limited to take it; ſo a remainder to him, That the particular Tenants ſhall name, and after he nameth one, yet the Remainder is void for the cauſe aforeſaid. But 32. <hi>H.</hi> 6. if the remainder is limited to the right Heirs of <hi>Jo. S.</hi> who is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and he die before the particular Tenant, is good, becauſe <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall be intended then dead; alſo becauſe by all preſumption, and intendment of Law, <hi>I. S.</hi> may have an Heir, which the Law will appoint in deſpight, and ſo will be certain; and therefore the Remainder good, but ſhall not be good where it ſtands indifferent, if he to whom the Remainder is limited, will be a perſon able, or not. Another Maxim is, That a Remainder may paſs out of the Leſſor at the time of the Livery; for that <hi>Richel</hi> ſaith in <hi>Litl.</hi> 162. the Remainder is void for this cauſe amongſt others: ſo here it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not by the firſt Livery, becauſe a Condition precedes the Commencement of the Remainder, <hi>viz.</hi> if <hi>W.</hi> die, living the Husband and Wife, then the remainder to the Defendant, and ſo paſſeth not at the firſt Livery; and therefore void.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brook,</hi> Serjeant to the contrary. As to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the time of the Entry, the Bar ſhall be intended the better for the Defendant, which is, That he entred immediately, and the Bar ſufficeth, which is good to a Common intent. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about 20. <hi>E.</hi> 3. it is holden, That if one plead in Bar, That one <hi>I. S.</hi> died ſeiſed, and <hi>R. S.</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred as Son and Heir to him, whoſe Eſtate he hath, this ſhall make the Bar good; and yet it may be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:120227:20"/>that he was not Heir, for it is not expreſly ſaid, That he is Son and Heir, but that he Entred as Son and Heir; and yet in as much as it is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by way of Bar, the beſt ſhall be intended for the Defendant; ſo here. And he argued beſides, much in effect as <hi>Cook</hi> did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanders,</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant. The Bar is good to a Common intent, and the beſt ſhall be intended for him which pleads it; for a Plea in Bar is alwaies made for two cauſes: The one to enforce the Plaintiff to make his replication. The other is to compel him to joyn Iſſue, which cannot be joyned upon the replication, as it may upon the Bar, and then the certainty ſhall be in it, and not of neceſſity in the Bar; and therefore the Bar good, if it be good to a Common intent. As in Aſſiſe, the Tenant pleads in Bar a diſcent to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and to two others, and that he hath the ſtate of one, and it is a good Plea, becauſe it is intended lawfully, yet he may have it by Diſſeiſen, and then he is a Diſſeiſor to the Plaintiff alſo; for he cannot be a Diſſeiſor to one, except he be ſo to the other. So 27. aſſ. 31. in an Aſſiſe by the Heir, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſaith, That the Father of the Plaintiff being Tenant by the courteſie, and now in life, Leaſed his Eſtate to his Father, which died, and he is in as Son and Heir, Judgement if Aſſiſe, and held a good Bar; yet he doth not ſay, That he was the firſt which entred, and yet good. So 21. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 17. here <hi>fol.</hi> 26. as to the Remainder it ſhall be good, becauſe it is a principle, that it ſhall be taken moſt ſtrongly againſt him which made it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. If a man gives to a man, and to Heirs, without [his] it is Fee; yet he giveth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> Fee expreſly. So 18. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 28. after 170. A good Remainder by word, That after the Deceaſe of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:120227:21"/>Tenant for Life, the Lands ſhall return to <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> in Fee. So a Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> in Life paſſeth preſently, and ſhall be in abey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance rather than void; and that if ſhall be to the benefit of the Leſſee againſt his own Livery and limitation, as alwaies the Law interprets words ſtrongeſt againſt the Speakers, as in 40. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 1. A Termor counts that he left this as good as he found it, and the Wind blew down the Houſe, it is not waſte, but Covenant lies, for the ſpecial Agreement alters the Law, and maketh his words to be taken more ſtrongly againſt him. So the Law taketh the Acts aforeſaid ſtrongly againſt the Makers. And therefore if <hi>I.</hi> give to <hi>B.</hi> Land upon Condition, That if he Marry my Daughter, he ſhall have Fee; if he Marries her he ſhall have Fee, for by the Livery it taketh Commencement, and by the performance of the Condition, it taketh perfection, and in the mean time it is ambiguous. So a Leaſe for years upon Condition, That one moneth after he ſhall have Fee, he ſhall have it after the moneth accordingly, for the thing paſſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant, moſt ſtrong againſt the Donor. So a Leaſe to two upon Condition, That if the one die within ſeven years, that then after the death of the other, it ſhall remain to a ſtranger, good; and Privies and ſtrangers are all one. 24. and 32. he differs, becauſe he hath an Eſtate firſt given, to which the Condition may be annexed, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and by imitation ſhall be taken ſtrongeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him which makes it. Three things one ſhall have by Remainder. Firſt, he ſhall have a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to veſt; Secondly, a Poſſeſſion in Law; and Thirdly, a Poſſeſſion in Deed, &amp; if he be capable at the time of the Poſſeſſion in Law caſt upon him, it ſufficeth (28. againſt it) as 17. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 29. and 18.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:120227:21"/>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 3. 15. a gift to one and his firſt begotten Son, and he hath no Son then, but afterwards he hath, is a good Remainder to his Son. So 39. Aſſiſe <hi>Pla.</hi> 20. a gift to Husband and Wife, and to one Heir of his body, is a good Remainder, yet no Heir to the gift, if he be in being when the Poſſeſſion in Law is caſt upon him; but a Remainder limited <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> upon contrariety, is not good (<hi>fol.</hi> 24.) according; but the other cauſe that <hi>Litl.</hi> aſſigns for that it veſts not at the time of the Livery, is no cauſe, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the caſes aforeſaid, becauſe after the Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gift, it may not remain to another. And the other cauſe that <hi>Litl.</hi> alleadgeth is, becauſe it veſts not at the time of Livery, which is no cauſe. So a gift to <hi>A.</hi> and his Heirs ſo long as <hi>B.</hi> ſhall have heirs of his body, Remainder to <hi>C.</hi> in Fee is void; for the contrariety, becauſe a Remainder cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a Fee determinable. So a Leaſe for life to <hi>A.</hi> upon Condition, That if <hi>B.</hi> pay 20. l. to the Leſſor, that then immediately it ſhall remain to <hi>B.</hi> is void for the contrariety, becauſe <hi>A.</hi> ought to have it during his life. But if it were to remain after the death of <hi>A.</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> then it were good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no contrariety there; and here if <hi>W.</hi> dies, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Husband and Wife, that then it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to to the Defendant, is not intendable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in their lives, but that it ſhould remain as it ought to remain, <hi>viz.</hi> after their deaths, and ſo there is no contrariety, and therefore good. As to the Condition which is ſubſequent if he would dwell there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe it hath two intendments; the one that he ſhould inhabite there all the Term, and the other to ſome time during his life, ſhall be taken ſtrictly, and the more ſtrongly againſt the Leſſor, <hi>viz.</hi> That he inhabites there at ſome times during his life which ſufficeth, as the Feoffee upon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:120227:22"/>Condition for to pay 10. l. to the Feoffor, and no time is limited he hath during his life. So to ſerve him in ſuch an Office, and ſaith not how long he hath, during his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harris,</hi> Serjeant to the ſame purpoſe. And as to the Exceptions he ſaid, That a Condition ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, and which goeth in the Defeaſance of the Eſtate, as here he that claims the Eſtate ſhall not ſhew it, but the other which will defeat the Eſtate. But where the Condition precedes the ſtate, he ſhall ſhew who ſhall have it, becauſe enabled thereunto; as if I grant a Rent Charge upon Condition, That he ſhall do ſuch an Act, there the Grantee ſhall avow for the rent without ſhewing the thing done, becauſe it is a condition ſubſequent, and defeats his Eſtate. But if I grant, That if he doth ſuch a thing, that then he ſhall have the rent, he ſhall not avow without performance ſhewed, becauſe he is enabled by this to the rent. 14. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Wheeler</hi> Grants his Term to one upon Condition, That he ſhall obtain the good will of the Leſſor, and then ſhall have it; he ſhall not have it until he hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the performance of the Condition, and he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the remainder upon Condition to be good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hales,</hi> Juſtice. If he would, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the Plea is inſufficient, becauſe the Defendant hath not averred his continual reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence after the Remainder happened; for during the Term, ſhall be intended all the Terms as it ſhall be in reſervation of rent or Covenant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair a houſe during the Term, 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 19. by <hi>Audley;</hi> ſo the Feoffees ſhall be intended all the Feoffees, and if he hath a reaſonable excuſe, he ought to ſhew it. <hi>fo.</hi> 272. <hi>viz.</hi> That he was 200. miles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> diſtant at the time of the Survivor of the Husband
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:120227:22"/>and Wife, and entred ſo ſoon as he had notice, which he ſhall ſhew in certain, that the Juſtice may trie it, as 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 27. Tenant for Life Leaſes for years, and dies; The Leſſor bringeth Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs againſt the Leſſee, who ſaith, That in as ſhort time as he could after that he had notice of the death of the Tenant for Life, he chaſed his beaſts forth of the land; and ſaid alſo that the Treſpaſs was between the death of the Tenant for Life, and the chaſing out of the beaſts, and held no plea; for by the death of Tenant for Life, the Leaſe for years was determined, and no man bound to give him notice; and there it is holden, that he ought to ſay; That ſuch a day he chaſed out the beaſts, and might ſhew that the Leſſor died in another County, and ſo he could not have ſo ſoon notice; and this ſhall be tried by the Juſtice if the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was in reaſonable time. So in this caſe the day of his Entry for the knowledge of the Jurors ought to be ſet forth; common intent is that which hath more vehement preſumption and intendment then any other intent hath, as 3. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 3. before 26. fully adminiſtred all goods which were the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors the day of his death, good; yet might have goods were not the Teſtators, which are aſſets after the Debts paid; but the moſt common intendment is, That he had no other goods, except thoſe which were the Teſtators, but intendment indifferent the more ſtrong intendment the one way or the other, and therefore ought to be pleaded in Bar, as 13. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 15. by <hi>Willoughby,</hi> the life of <hi>ceſtui que vie</hi> is pleaded in a Leaſe for another life which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different if he be alive or not. So if he pleads a releaſe made after the Obligation, it is not good if he ſhews it not by expreſs words, that it was delivered after; it ſhall be intended that it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120227:23"/>was delivered when it bears Date. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part it ſhall be intended alſo, That the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would not bring an Action if it were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after, and therefore ſhall be ſhewed which intendment ſtands indifferent; ſo here. A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer all times after the Remainder happens or not, is incertain, and therefore becauſe he hath not ſhewed this, the Plea is nought. As to the matter in Law, it ſeemeth to him that the remainder is good; for a man may paſs the thing in queſtion when, where, and how he will if it be not againſt Law, nor repugnant, as here the limitation, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder is not againſt Law; for the remainder need not paſs forth of the Leſſor, <hi>ſo.</hi> 29. for upon the Agreement firſt had by Act made afterwards, Franck-Tenement, or remainder, may be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and deveſted from one, &amp; veſted in another; as a Leaſe for life, remainder for life upon condition, That it ſhall be void if he doth not ſuch an act, the remainder before the Condition broken is in him; when broken it commeth to the Leſſor. So a rent or Reverſion paſſeth by Attornment, not by the Grant preſently. So 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7.31. by <hi>Brian,</hi> a remainder to the <hi>K.</hi> when the Deed is inrolled, then it ſhall paſs and relate to the Livery. So in the caſe of <hi>Pleſſington</hi> 6. <hi>R.</hi> 2. where the Condition was, That if the Leſſor die within the Term, the Leſſee ſhall have for life, and there holden that his eſtate ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged if the Leſſor die. So Diſſeiſen to the uſe of <hi>I.</hi> paſſeth not a Free hold of <hi>I.</hi> to <hi>I.</hi> without his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement; ſo here. A remainder paſſeth when <hi>W.</hi> died, not before, by force of the words annexed to the Livery. So by <hi>Litl.</hi> a confirmation to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, Tenants for life, paſſes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the Husband, yet it paſſeth not at the time of the firſt Eſtate, and the diverſity where Fee
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120227:23"/>upon Condition is appointed to privy, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtranger is but a conceit which is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, (29. according 24. to the contrary,) and is privity becauſe it reſerveth out of both; ſo it ſhall bind him in remainder, and alſo he in remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall have waſte, and ſo is privy to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Eſtate, and the Leſſor alſo; and the words then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> which ſhall remain, ſhall not be intended preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſtroy the particular Eſtate, but ſhall remain as a remainder ought to diveſt then, and is to be executed after their deaths; as if Donee in Tail doth ſuch an Act, then to remain to his right heirs, which veſts when the Act is done, and after the Tail ended, ſhall be executed, and not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Act done to avoid the Tail; ſo here. There is not any repugnancie or prejudice to any; but a thing when it is done, made in prejudice of another, ſhall be void; as a remainder that he ſhall have the land in the life of the particular Tenant. So 21. <hi>E.</hi> 4.44. The King diſcharges an Abbot, That he ſhall not be a Collector, when any Titles ſhould be granted by the Clergy of <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> Grants Tythes, provided that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector returned by the Biſhop, ſhall not be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the King; and the Biſhop returns the Abbot Collector; there holden that the Grant by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in this point, <hi>viz.</hi> to charge perſons exempt, is void, becauſe it is in prejudice of others. And ſo the remainder here ſhall be void, rather then a ſhranger ſhall have prejudice by it; but for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults in the pleading, the Plaintiff ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hinde,</hi> Juſtice to the 3. exception; the death of the particular Tenant ſhall not be ſhewed, which is onely conveyance of the execution of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, and is not Traverſable, nor Iſſuable.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:120227:24"/>To the firſt, and Second exceptions, he needs not ſhew his continual reſidence after the Remainder is fallen, nor the day of his entry, becauſe it is a Condition ſubſequent, and goes in defeaſe of his Eſtate; and he which hath benefit by it, ought to ſhew it; as 29. <hi>H.</hi> 6.22. the Grantee of an annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity <hi>pro concilio impendendo,</hi> ſhall have the Annuity without ſhewing that he hath given Councel, for that the ſhewing of it is not beneficial to him, and the denial of Councel defeats the Annuity; ſo he agrees to the diverſity in caſe of Annuity. 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7.1. <hi>bont. fol.</hi> 25 by <hi>Pollard</hi> when one ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, and therefore the ſhewing hereof that which is ſurpluſage, and the imperfectneſs of it ſhall not make the Bar vitious; and the Remainder here by him commenceth not upon Condition; but it is a limitation, and explanation from the time that it firſt begun for nothing, or words makes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition but ſuch, which reſtrains the thing given; as If <hi>I.</hi> Leaſe for life upon Condition, That if the Leſſee die, or maketh waſte, and <hi>I.</hi> recover the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> place waſted, or any parcel of it, That <hi>I.</hi> ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into all; for it is a Condition for that part in which no waſte is done, becauſe it reſtrains and defeats that part. And if it be a Condition here, yet the Remainder thereupon is good, if it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced and veſted at any time during the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Eſtates; (24, 29. 32, 34.) for when he hath Fee-Simple, he may Condition with it as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, if it be not againſt Law; as if <hi>I.</hi> Leaſe for life upon Condition, That <hi>I. S.</hi> paies to me 20. l. that <hi>I.</hi> ſhall enter, then the Remainder is void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the entry avoids the firſt eſtate, and then no particular eſtate continues upon which a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may depend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brown,</hi> Juſtice to the ſame purpoſe. The entry
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:120227:24"/>of the Defendant, ſhall be intended immediately, for this is the moſt common intent; and a Bar good to a common intent, ſhall be intended that he entred preſently after his Title accrued, and to the matter in Law, hold that the remainder ſhall be good upon Condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montague,</hi> Chief Juſtice to the ſame intent. The entry of the Defendant ſhall be intended pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; for this is the moſt common intent; and a Bar good to a common intent, is good; as 21. <hi>E.</hi> 4.83. in Aſſize the Tenant pleads a diſcent to him as Son and Heir, and he entred, and it was held good; yet the Father of the Plaintiff might have abated, and died ſeiſed, and then the Plaintiff is in as Son and Heir, in which caſe the Tenant might not enter. But this is not intendable; but the moſt common intent is, That the Tenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred immediatly after the death of of his Father. So 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4.12. in Debt againſt five Executors, at the Diſtreſs, 3. makes Default, 2. appears and pleads Recovery againſt them two of 300. and that more they had not in their hands. Exception taken, That becauſe by intent there ſhould be five Executors, two might have abated the firſt ſuit, and ſo the Recovery not duly had, but holden good: becauſe it may be that then they two onely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, and then they did lie againſt them two onely; and the moſt common intent is, that it might be ſo rather than at firſt to loſe advantage to have abated the Writ; and therefore the Plea in Bar was held good, and Execution duly had; and if it were otherwiſe, the Plaintiff ought to have ſhewed it. So 21. <hi>E.</hi> 4.8.1. <hi>In formidon in diſcender,</hi> The Tenant pleads the releaſe of the Demandant without Warranty in Bar, yet might be made by him in the life time of the father, and then
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:120227:25"/>it is no Bar; but it ſhall be intended to be made after the death of the Father, if the Demandant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies not to the contrary; but if he which pleads in Bar is bound at a time certain, he ought to ſhew the day of his Act certainly (24, 26, 27.) as the day of entry for Mortmain, ſo that it may appear to be within the year. So if one juſtifies for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon between <hi>Lammas</hi> and <hi>Candlemas.</hi> So if one juſtifies by Warrant, by Licence, by Authority, he alwaies ought to ſhew the time certain of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; ſo that pleading in abatement of the Writ, or a plea after the laſt continuance, ought to plead certainly; and theſe are obſerved as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in our Law; but he which pleads in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> ought not to plead certainly. If he would dwell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is like that it is not a Condition here, becauſe it is not compulſive, ſo that he ſhall have prejudice if he doth not, but is a thing obligable at the will of the Defendant, and then his entry is not material, but is at pleaſure; and therefore the not ſhewing thereof ſhall not make the Plea vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Admitting that it be a Condition, yet it is ſubſequent, and in Defeaſance of his Eſtate. (30.) And therefore ſhall not be ſhewed by him, but by him which ſhall have benefit by the breaking of it. So if a Condition be enlarged, which may be good, leaveth that out which is material, becauſe it is Surpluſſage. Alſo it hath no Livery for to convey Title, nor hath it enabled him any waies to take the benefit of the breach of the Condition if it were broken, becauſe he hath Demurred ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally upon the Bar, in which the Defendant hath not acknowledged any reverſion. And ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not by the Record that he is other then a meer ſtranger. And by the Common Law no man ſhall take benefit of a Condition, but ſuch a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:120227:25"/>one as is privy. And therefore 38. <hi>H.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees</hi> of the King (after 177.) Alſo if it be a Condition during the Term, it ſhall be intended all the Term; as a man bound to perform Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, is bound to perform all, and his Feoffees. (<hi>fol.</hi> 30.) Yet if he be ſometimes abſent, and his Family there, it is good, becauſe the Law ſhall have a reaſonable Conſtruction in things alwaies. If <hi>W.</hi> dies, then the Remainder is a Limitation, and appoyntment of the time when the remainder ſhall veſt. But admitting that it be a Condition, yet a Remainder may depend upon a Condition, which every lawfull owner of the land may give to what perſon or perſons, and in what manner, and at what time he pleaſeth, if his gift be not againſt Law, or repugnant; as 10. <hi>E.</hi> 3.39. A man makes to his Termor in ſurety of his Term, a Charter of Feoffment upon Condition, That if he be diſturbed of any part of his Term, that then he ſhall have Fee; he was diſturbed, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards outed, and recovers in Aſſiſe, which proves that the Franck-Tenant paſſed upon condition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to the Livery; &amp; be it mediate, or immediate, it ſtales not the Remainder, becauſe his Livery ſhall be taken moſt ſtrongly againſt him. So 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8.24. Remainder to a ſtranger if the gift fail, for bearing of the ſtandard. So in <hi>Pleſſintons</hi> caſe it is held, That the eſtate of Free-hold there could not Commence upon Condition: but the cauſe wherefore, was becauſe he had not the Free-hold upon performance of the Condition, which was repugnancie. So a Remainder upon condition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law, or impoſſible, is not good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Condition unlawfull, or impoſſible, may not obtain the thing by doing of it. So if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:120227:26"/>repugnant; for when he hath aliened to one, it may not remain to another. Remainder ought to have eſtate precedent; for that 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6.24. Leaſe to a Monk, Remainder over void, becauſe a Monk hath not capacity, and ſo the eſtate which precedes the Remainder, void. Remainder alſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> ought to be of a thing in <hi>eſſe</hi> before; and therefore a Grant of a rent out of land, remainder in Fee, void; becauſe the rent was not in <hi>eſſe</hi> before; and the remainder here paſſeth preſently by the Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon poſſibility to be afterwards performed, and veſts when <hi>W.</hi> dies, and in the mean time reſts in abeyance; as 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7.10. Fee Tail paſſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on poſſibility, That a Fem Covert, and a married man may inter-marry, and in the mean time the Inheritance, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tail ſhall be in abeyance, but holden there, That they are ſeiſed in Tail pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and concludes that the Remainder is good, and the pleading alſo; and ſo the Plaintiff ſhall be Barred.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reſpect that after the eſcape, the Plaintiff ſhall not have other execution, and ſo without any remedie againſt the Defendant, in the firſt ſuit the Common Law which is Common Reaſon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, That the Plaintiff ſhall have an Action of Debt againſt the Gaoler, in whoſe default the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Plaintiff, or otherwiſe the Common Law will be defective in this point. And therefore by 45. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 9. Abridged by <hi>Fitz. h. in Title Debt.</hi> 130. which was before the Stat. of <hi>R.</hi> 2. where a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> dative and removeable, lets one in Execution in his Guard for dammages recovered in his Court of Py-powder eſcape, <hi>P.

But it had been good, if the <hi>Prior</hi> had been omitted; and Debt is maintainable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contract between them, or privity, in poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the eſcape. As 1. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 8. againſt the Clark of Hamper, upon a <hi>Liberate</hi> delivered to him when the Comiſor hath aſſets.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:120227:27"/>it is benificial to many others; As 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspecte agatis</hi> extends to all other Biſhops as well as <hi>Norwich.</hi> So the Statute of 9. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 5.

Debt upon an eſcape of one in Execution, was maintainable againſt the Major of the <hi>Staple,</hi> who in excuſe of himſelf, ſaith, That he was impriſoned by force of a plaint, and not in Execution; the words of <hi>R.</hi> 2. prohibites the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the <hi>Fleet</hi> onely to ſuffer any in Execution to go out of Priſon by Baſton, Mainpriſe or Bail, and by equity all other Gaolers; yet theſe in <hi>London</hi> uſe it, and it is not an eſcape in them, becauſe they may preſcribe againſt the equity and words of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, which is contrary to their Cuſtoms and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions; for that their Cuſtoms as Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are confirmed by Statute; and contrary to the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Silva cedua,</hi> and keeping gof <hi>Leets</hi> at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times then the <hi>Statute</hi> appoints, and ſo let them in execution to go by Baſton within their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But others ſhall be bound by equity of the ſaid <hi>Statute;</hi> and becauſe this <hi>Statute</hi> extends to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by equity in this point of eſcape, it ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend alſo to an Action to charge other Officers as to matters of eſcape. A priſoner marry the Warden of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> this is an eſcape, and he is at liberty, for he cannot be under his Wifes Cuſtody. So if the Office diſcends to an Heir which is a priſoner, there he ſhall be adjudged at Liberty, although he lieth in fetters, becauſe he cannot be his own keeper in priſon.</p>

As to the Obligation, That becauſe the Defendant in Bar in ſaying whoſe heir he is, hath affirmed the Plaintiff to be heir, and therefore in the Replication hath conveyed himſelf to his entry as Heir ſpecial, and ſo the Replication ill, for default of certainty. Secondly, for that the Plaintiff hath not ſhewed that execution was had of the ſaid recovery againſt the Defendant. Thirdly, Exception becauſe he hath not ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Covin ſpecially; for otherwiſe it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendable in Recoveries, becauſe they are alwaies intended true, and upon good cauſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wife at the Common Law, by default a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, and her husband, had not any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy then a Writ of Right before the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. which gives a <hi>Cui in vita:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. a faint Recovery againſt Tenant for life, bound him in Remainder. <hi>Litl.</hi> Releaſe, 112. becauſe the Law preſumes the Title and caſe true.

So here the Recovety is intended to be true; and therefore the Plaintiff ought to ſhew matter (if there be any) to prove the contrary. As in 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4.19. if the Tenant in a <hi>precipe</hi> vouch one of the Demandants, he ought to ſhew cauſe; becauſe otherwiſe the Law will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that he hath not cauſe againſt right. So 15. <hi>E.</hi> 4.4. Contrary entry by Title, general averment of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> Covin by the Plaintiff in Dower, was not held good.<note place="margin">Matter in Law.</note> As to the matter in Law, it ſeemeth here
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:120227:29"/>that the caſe is clear out of the words and penalty of the <hi>Statute</hi> of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. For although 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath executed the Poſſeſſion to the uſe, yet this caſe remains here, ſo as if 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. had never been made, and the Wife had continued Tenant in Tail in uſe, and out of the words of the firſt branch becauſe he hath an Eſtate Tail in the uſe in the land, but hath not an Eſtate in the land in the uſe; and the <hi>Statute</hi> ſpeaks of an Eſtate in the Land; and this Hereditament or uſe, which is the matter and ſubſtance, and the uſe it ſelf, which is the confidence of the thing, differ. But one may not have the ſtate in Land and uſe alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuſpended; yet two may, to the uſe of one of them; as Husband and Wife to the uſe of the Wife; and ſo it ſhall be intended here. Alſo the firſt branch ſpeaks of lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Inheritance or purchaſe of the Husband; but here the uſe is a new thing, which Commenceth now and was not in being before; and ſo is not the inheritance or purchaſe of the Husband; and therefore out of the <hi>Statute;</hi> as a Rent granted to one out of lands to the uſe of the Wife of the Grantor; or if the Husband gives a ſigniory in Tail to the Wife for her Joyncture, and the Tenancie Eſcheat, and the Wife ſuffer a faint Recovery, this is forth of the <hi>Statute.</hi> So the Husband makes a Feoffment upon Condition to re-enfeoffee him, and his Wife in Tail, the Wife ſuffers a faint Recovery; this is out of the <hi>Statute;</hi> becauſe the Feoffment of the Land from the Poſſeſſion of the Husband, and was her purchaſe, and not the purchaſe of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or his Inheritance; for the Condition, which is the cauſe of the gift, is a new thing, is not within the ſecond branch; becauſe the Wife had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:120227:30"/>nothing here of the gift of any of the Anceſtors of the husband. Nor the third branch, becauſe the wife had not poſſeſſion by the <hi>Statute,</hi> nor by the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees to the uſe of him in Reverſion, but he in Reverſion hath the preſent Title; and ſo the <hi>Statute</hi> ſhall be intended; and therefore he may enter preſently: If Tenant for Life ſuffer a faint Recovery; but 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. ſaith Enjoy according to their Title, intends that he ſhall not Enter until after the death of his Anceſtor, becauſe he hath no Title in the life of his Anceſtor. And therefore when the Wife aſſents to the Raviſher, 6. <hi>R.</hi> 2. gives title of entry; ſaying, <hi>habeat titulum intrandi,</hi> &amp;c. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that he ſhall not have it in the life of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor. And if the makers of the <hi>Statute</hi> of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. had intended that the iſſue in Tail ſhould have entred preſently, they would have given to him Title by ſuch like words as the <hi>Statute</hi> of 6. <hi>R.</hi> 2. hath; but the end of the clauſe which ſaith, That they ſhall enjoy according to their Title, expreſſes that they intented not ſo. For which cauſes it is probable that the Defendant is out of the penalty of the <hi>Statute;</hi> and that the Plaintiff might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo ſhall be Barred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whiddon,</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff. Becauſe the Defendant hath ſaid whoſe Heir he is, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> ſhall be taken that he is Heir ſpecial; for a Plea which hath two intendments, ſhall be taken moſt ſtrongly againſt him which pleads it; as 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7.2. in Treſpaſs, Releaſe generally is no Plea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be taken to be delivered before the Treſpaſs, or after. So 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7.8. and 9. and 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Entry to avoid <hi>Warranty Collaterall,</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Bar, is no Plea; becauſe it may be intended after the diſcent; for he may enter in the life of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120227:30"/>the Anceſtor, or after. Alſo the Plaintiff need not ſhew how he is Heir, becauſe he was once ſeiſed by entry. But if he had brought a formedon upon the Eſtate Tail, he ſhould; becauſe by way of Demand; as 6. <hi>E.</hi> 4.1. Executor brought Treſpaſs for a thing taken out of his Poſſeſſion, he ſhall not ſhew his Teſtament; but if he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a thing whereof he had not ever poſſeſſion; he ſhall. It is not needfull to ſhew Covin certainly, which is a ſecret thing; and the Law doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force one to ſhew a thing, when by intendment of Law it lieth not in his Conuſance; as 20. <hi>H.</hi> 7.7. A woman ſhall have Dower of a Rent Charge without ſhewing the Deed of the Grant; becauſe it belongeth not to her. So the Lord ſhall have Covin generally for the Ward, where his Tenant aliens, and re-taketh for life, the Remainder to his Heir, being it lieth ſecretly in the breaſt, as ſuſpicion lieth; for that he may juſtiſie impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment for ſuſpicion of Felony, without ſhewing of the cauſe of his ſuſpicion. So 33. <hi>H.</hi> 6.5. In Treſpaſs, a man buys in a Market Overt; the Plaintiff ſaid, That the ſaid buying was by fraud between the Defendant and a ſtranger gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, without ſhewing any thing ſpeciall of the Covin; and the Plea the e admitted good, So in a <hi>Precipe</hi> againſt the Lord of ancient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſne, and Tenant, the Lord ſhall ſhew that he is Lord; and this Action is brought againſt him by Covin generally. So 9. <hi>E.</hi> 6.41. He which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadges Covin, ought to ſhew cauſe of the Covin; and the cauſe is, for that the Recovery, or Title was tryed by Verdict; becauſe to ſay that it was by Covin, ſhall not be intended true againſt a Verdict. But Covin generally may be averred, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:120227:31"/>a Recovery not gainſaying or default; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is cauſe of the Judgement, and no Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Wherefore in this caſe a man ſhall aver that this was by Covin generally. And as to that which hath been ſaid, That execution ought to be ſhewed of the Recovery; that needs not: For the <hi>Statute</hi> ſpeaketh only of the Recovery, and without Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, it ſhall be a Recovery, as a Fine is without Attornment; for the <hi>habere facias ſeiſinam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites <hi>cum A recuperavit ſeiſinam ſuam,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe the Husband raiſed the uſe. Firſt it is his purchaſe, and ſo within the words of the <hi>Statute;</hi> and if not, yet it ſhall be within the equity; and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is penal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanders,</hi> for the Defendant. The <hi>Statute</hi> here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> is penal; becauſe it goeth in avoidance of Eſtates, and abridges power; and therefore not equitable. And for this <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. before <hi>fol.</hi> 17. <hi>expectet emptor</hi> for Warranty; becauſe he vouches an Infant; and yet it is adjudged 18. <hi>E.</hi> 4.16. If he maketh a Feoffment over, this Feoffee ſhall vouch; becauſe penall againſt one, ſhall not extend to another. So by 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. The dying ſeiſed of a diſſeiſor without peaceable poſſeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for five years ſhall not take away the Entry of the diſſeiſee; yet if one Abator die ſeiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five years, this diſcent ſhall take away the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And ſo if Tenant for life be diſſeiſed, and the diſſeiſor die within five years, and the Tenant for Life dieth, he in Reverſion or Remainder may not Enter; becauſe he was no Diſſeiſor to them; and to the diſcent, they had no Title to Enter, but the Tenant for Life, and taken ſtrictly; becauſe it abridgeth the Liberty given by the Common-Law. By inheritance is underſtood Land by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:120227:31"/>as it is proved by a caſe in 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4.5. and a <hi>cui in vita</hi> abated, becauſe it was <hi>quam clamat eſſe jus &amp; Hereditatem ſuam;</hi> whereas it was his own purchaſe. And by 4. <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. which ſpeaketh of Lands by purchaſe, or by diſcent, and the disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive prove the difference between the words. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe intends Land by gift or purchaſe, which is by Title. Diſſeiſen is not purchaſe, becauſe without Title. Now becauſe the Plaintiff hath in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication ſaid, That the Grandfather of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was ſeiſed in Fee; for to prove the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to be within the firſt Branch; the Plaintiff ought to ſhew here how the Husband of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> came to the Poſſeſſion; for the manner of coming to the Land is Iſſuable, becauſe it may be by Diſcent, Purchaſe, or Diſſeiſen. And a Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture made by a Diſſeiſor to his wife, is out of the <hi>Statute;</hi> Recovery without Execution is not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harris,</hi> Serjeant argues to the ſame intent; And he taketh alſo, that Covin cannot be where the Title is good, except that wrong be done by him which hath the Title; and this ought to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for here in reſpect that the Title is confeſſed to be good in this, That it is not traverſed, nor confeſſed and avoided; this Recovery may not be averred to be by Covin; for this avernment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant in it ſelf, and it cannot ſtand together to ſay that ſhe did right by Covin. And as to the <hi>Statute</hi> he taketh the caſe here to be out of the words of the <hi>Statute.</hi> And note thou that he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued to all the other points moved to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they were arguod before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Molineux,</hi> Juſtice. It is a vain thing to aver this ſpecially, which is apparant, as the Covin, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:120227:32"/>therefore when the Tenant infeoffes his Son within age by Colluſion, the Lord ſhall ſeiſe him for a Ward, without ſhewing this Colluſion ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So if the Husband will confeſs an Action, the Wife ſhall have Dower by the Common Law, proved by recital <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. For it is intendable by the Law to be Covin apparant; but it was doubted if the Recovery had been by Default; but here the Action had been tryed by the Verdict of 12. men, the cauſe of the Covin ought to have been ſhewed, becauſe the Law giveth credence to it. As 5. <hi>H.</hi> 7.20 Upon an <hi>Attaint</hi> no <hi>Superſedeas</hi> ſhall be granted, becauſe the Law preſumes the Verdict to be true, untill the Reverſal be tryed upon Error, in Deed or Record; ſo that the Law hath an indifferent judgement of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to be true or falſe. And ſo the Covin averred in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance of the trial by Verdict ſhall be ſhewed certainly for the credence given to the Verdict. Alſo Covin upon a good Title is prohibited; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Statute</hi> of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. is generall. And ſo Covin generally averred here, without falſifying of the Title, is good; as 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. ſaith, That if a Recovery be pleaded in Bar of a popular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Plaintiff may aver it was by Covin gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the Warrant of the <hi>Statute.</hi> As to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond exception, the <hi>Stat.</hi> expounds it ſelf to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of a Recovery without execution. Every Fee-ſimple is an inheritance, and then ſhe had an uſe in the inheritance of her Husband; and held that the Wife held the inheritance of her Husband, (that is to ſay) his Land in uſe joyntly with her Husband, and ſo within the words of the <hi>Statute,</hi> and if not, it ſhall be within the equity and intent of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;</hi> and he took without queſtion, that the Heir
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:120227:32"/>in Tail might enter preſently, and our the Wife which is Defendant, and ſo held the Plaintiff ſhould recover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hales,</hi> Juſtice to the ſame intent. And firſt to the Covin, the Replication is good without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe of it. And the <hi>Statute</hi> is for frail, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant women, and will not make them Judges, if the Title of Action be good or not. 18. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. gives receipt to him in Reverſion; where the Tenant for Life is impleaded by Covin of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandants, that the Tenements ſhall be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and he in Reverſion, becauſe it ſpeaks gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of Covin. 2. <hi>H.</hi> 6.14. and 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4.3. For this cauſe there it ſufficeth to ſay, That Tenant for Life pleaded faintly, and pray to be received without ſhewing cauſe; otherwiſe it is of Covin at the Common Law; and 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. would have limited the pain to fained recoveries expreſly, if it had intended ſo much. And the <hi>Statute</hi> prohibits the Covin onely, be the Title good or faint, for faint Recoverie by Covin, the iſſue in Tail may falſifie before Warranty made 20. years after the Diſſeiſen; yet it commenceth by Diſſeiſen, by the intent. As if the Father Diſſeiſeth the Son, to the intent to make a Feoffment with Warranty to Bar his Wife, Recovers againſt one which outs the Tenant by Covin; yet ſhe had not good Title of Dower, is a Diſſeiſereſs; and Covin is apparent here, becauſe he never took view, voucher, eſſoin, or other delays which he might. The <hi>Statute</hi> ſaith, That the Recovery ſhall be void, whereby it is not intended that it ſhall be executed, and ſhall not be intended to be by Diſſeiſen without ſhewing.</p>
               <p>The words of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. explain the intent, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> ſuch Wives who have Lands in uſe, or uſe in Lands,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:120227:33"/>are within the <hi>Statute.</hi> Recovery againſt Tenant in Tail, was good onely for his life before this <hi>Stat.</hi> and therefore compriſes uſe here, becauſe the <hi>Stat.</hi> ſhall not be made in vain; for Tail in uſe may do as great prejudice, as Tail in poſſeſſion, and ſo the intent ſhall aid the obſcurity of the words in Conſtruction of words; but if it be not within the words, yet it ſhall be taken by equity; becauſe it reſtrains Liberty that the Common Law gave to the prejudice of another, as here of Tenant in Tail to bind their iſſues by recovery or Warranty. So <hi>Marlebridge, cap.</hi> 6. ſpeaks of a Leaſe for years for to defraud the Lord of Ward; yet if it were for Life, or in Tail, taken by equity. So <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. ſpeaks of 3. gifts in Tail; yet 4. <hi>H.</hi> 5.6. and 19. <hi>H.</hi> 6.74. compriſe by equity all manner of intails, becauſe it reſtrains liberty of breaking the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Donor, ſuffer by the Common Law. So <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. gives receipt to the Reverſioner by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to the Remainder; for the Common Law, which may not ſuffer him to be received, ſuffers a wrong, and this <hi>Statute</hi> remedies it. So 13. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. gives receipt for faint pleading by equity; receipt by equity ſhall be for faint defending. So an Adminiſtrator ſhall have account by equity of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> the <hi>Statute,</hi> where it is given to Executors onely. So 1. <hi>H.</hi> 7.3. gives an Action of Forgery of falſe Deeds, by which the Title and Poſſeſſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are diſturbed in the Copulative by equity, if the Title onely be diſturbed; and therefore the diſſeiſee which hath not but onely a right, ſhall have an Action in 4. <hi>H.</hi> 6.26. becauſe where the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective ſuffers a thing which is a wrong to another, and a <hi>Statute</hi> redreſſeth it, there things in the like miſchief ſhall be taken by equity, in the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:120227:33"/>So here becauſe it is made in avoidance of Covin, therefore it is beneficial to the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brown,</hi> Juſtice, argued to the contrary for 2. cauſes in the Pleading. The one was for that the cauſe of the Covin was not ſhewed; for howbeit that the <hi>Statute</hi> ſpeaks generally of Covin, yet it refers the pleading of this to the Common Law; and therefore becauſe the cauſe of Covin was not ſhewed, the replication was nought. The other cauſe was, for that the Plaintiffs have not ſhewed how the Wife Plaintiff was Heir, and therefore may not be ſeiſed in Tail, as it was pleaded. And as to the execution, he held that it was not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be ſhewed. And as to the matter in Law, he held the caſe here within the words of the <hi>Statute;</hi> and if it were not, yet he held them within the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; for that the <hi>Statute</hi> was made in avoidance of Covin, which is to be abhorred; and therefore the <hi>Statute</hi> is benificial to the Common-wealth; But for the ſaid defaults in the replication, he held that the Plaintiffs ſhould not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montague,</hi> Chief Juſtice. Title amends not Covin, for it may be upon a good Title; and therefore the books are, If a Wife recover Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt <hi>A.</hi> who by Covin enters, and outs the Tenant, as in 15. <hi>E.</hi> 4.4. yet ſhe is a Diſſeiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs; and by 8. <hi>H.</hi> 4.6. where the iſſue in Tail recovers againſt <hi>A.</hi> who by Covin Diſſeiſe the Diſcontinuee; yet 18. <hi>H.</hi> 8.5. is not remitted, although his Title good, but is a Diſſeiſor by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Covin. The Title of a man ſhall not be tryed between ſtrangers, where he which hath the Title is not party, nor ſhew Covin, becauſe it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120227:34"/>is a thing ſecretly determined to the prejudice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; as Joyntenancie on part of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff; the Defendant which pleads this, ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="55"/> not ſhew of whoſe Feoffment; for that, that he may have knowledge of it by preſumption of Law on his own part here. <hi>H.</hi> 21. <hi>E.</hi> 4.78. and 19. <hi>H.</hi> 6.32. So 19. <hi>H.</hi> 79. he which pleads a Deed which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to him, ſhall not be enforced to ſhew it: a man may aver Covin generally, where aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is given by <hi>Statute,</hi> or Common Law; as the <hi>Statute</hi> of 13. <hi>R.</hi> 2. giveth receipt for faint plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and may alleadge it generally when he prays to be received. So a Termor for years by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Glouceſtor</hi> ſhall be received, and aver Covin ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally; and faint pleading, and Covin is all one. So 8. <hi>H.</hi> 6.7. In Aſſiſe the Tenant makes default; one ſhall anſwer for him as Baily, he appears and diſallows him, and ſaith, That he will make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault; the Bailiffs comes and Demands Conuſance of this default made by Covin for to take away their Conuſance generally, and holden good. So 10. <hi>H.</hi> 6.15. In Formedon one Demandant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Tenant in Challenge which he made to a Juror; the other Demandant avers the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to be made by Covin generally, and good. So if one pleads impriſonment in excuſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, or ſale in a Market overt; the other avers, That it is by Covin generally; or if he pleads a Feoffment, the other avers, That it was by Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty generally, and ſo may aver Covin given by the <hi>Statute</hi> or Common Law generally, where the cauſe of it may not be ſpecial: if it may be ſpecial otherwiſe, it is 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4.15. <hi>in ſcire facias,</hi> the Wife received, pleads a recovery by a ſtranger, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a not denial, and execution againſt him; it is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:120227:34"/>but the acknowledgement of the Tenant, and his own Act, and ſo Covenous. Faint recovery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Tenant in Tail, which dies before executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the iſſue is remitted, and the Recovery not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutory againſt him, and ſo is defeaſable; yet the Covin in the Recovery, which is as a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is cauſe of the forfeiture of the State; as a Feoffment upon Condition, not to infeoffee <hi>I.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that he within age infeoffees <hi>I.</hi> and ſo the State is defeaſable, yet he hath broken the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And as to the other exception taken, for that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/> it was not ſhewed certainly how he was Heir. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> held the Replication nought; for Replicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Titles, Pleas in abatement of Writs, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopples, ought to comprehend certainty; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication forceth the party to iſſue, and therefore ſhall be certain, becauſe the Court, nor the Jury may not be inveigled, or troubled for the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Replication, which maketh the iſſue, ordained and provided that they ſhould be certain. But a Bar which is certain to a common intent, is good; for a man ſhall plead in Bar an Eſtate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing how, it is not good; as it is holden 2. <hi>E.</hi> 4.26. and every Replication ought to ſhew contrary matter to the Bar, and then ought to take Traverſe, or confeſſe, and avoid the Bar. And here the Bar is good, and the Replication con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a misbehavior of the Wife of the Defendant, by which here Eſtate is void, and then the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ought to make him able for to take benefit of the misbehavior of the Defendant: and here the Heir pleads this ability certainly, the Bar which is plainly confeſſed, is not plainly avoided; for it appeareth not here how the Plaintiff is coſen to <hi>G.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:120227:35"/>T.</hi> &amp; <hi>pretoxtu quorum premiſſoy,</hi> refers to him which is ſaid before, onely as it is expounded 7. <hi>H.</hi> 6.51. in a Bill of Debt againſt the Warden of the <hi>Fleet.</hi> 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7.13. where one binds himſelfe, That he will not claim, nor enter into the ſaid land in bar, that he entred not, nor claimed; the Plaintiff re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that he claims, he ought to ſay how, <hi>viz.</hi> That he came to the Land, and claimed, and entred.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:120227:35"/>ſimplici facit,</hi> &amp;c. of Fee-Tail not, but it diſcends to the youngeſt Son of the half bloud.

The Wife ſhall recover her Land given <hi>cauſa matrimonii praelocuti,</hi> if the Feoffee will not marry her. So ſhall have all Free-hold after Divorce.

So 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. intends to puniſh women, if they will recompence this favor of the Law with wrong to the diſinheriſon of Heirs; here the Wife hath an Eſtate in the uſe, and by his inheredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Land; and Uſe alſo is the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Husband, and therefore within the words of the <hi>Statute;</hi> becauſe an Uſe is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament.

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:120227:36"/>8. The Parliament made the Conveyance of the Land from one to another; and the Feoffees are Donors; for when a Gift is made by Parliament, every one by it is privy, and aſſents to it; yet the thing ſhall paſs from him which hath moſt right, and moſt Authority to give it. As in 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7.32. He to whoſe Uſe, and the Feoffee joyn in a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſhall be ſaid the Feoffment of the Feoffee; for they have moſt Authority for to give this. So Tenant for Life, and he in a Reverſion joyns in a Feoffment, it ſhall be adjudged the Livery of the Tenant for Life. So if one ſeiſed in Fee, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other which hath nothing joyns in a Feoffment, it ſhall be ſaid the Feoffment of him which hath right, and the confirmation of the other. So here it ſhall be ſaid the Gift by Parliament of the Feoffees, and the aſſent and confirmation of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For if any other ſhall be adjudged the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, the Parliament ſhould do wrong to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees in taking the thing from them. And an Act of Parliament will not prejudice any man, as 19. <hi>H.</hi> 6.62. the <hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>Edington</hi> had an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Tythes</hi> by the Kings Grant, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards agrees to the Act which granted <hi>Tythes</hi> to the King, and ſo was one of the Grantors, yet ſhall not take benefit by this, but ſhall be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. For the Common Law ſaith, <hi>That none ſhall be damnified by ſuch general Act made by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and therefore <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120227:37"/>it was for to redreſs falſe Covin, for to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance right and juſtice and benificial to the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, As <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. gives a <hi>cui in vita</hi> upon a recovery by default, which was a wrong to the Wife, and therefore gave <hi>Cui ante Divortium</hi> by equity. So <hi>Marlebridge, cap. 6. De primogenith,</hi> and of Feoffment; yet if the firſt Son dies, and he infeoffees the ſecond Son, or Levy a Fine, it ſhall be taken by equity; becauſe it redreſſes Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, which the Law abhors. So 1. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. gives a Formedon in Remainder againſt Pernors of Profits. and 14. <hi>H.</hi> 7.31. and after 178. <hi>ſcire facias</hi> for to execute a Remainder againſt the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Profits, ſhall be maintainable by equity.

               <p>Note, that all the Juſtices held the caſe here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the words of the Statute of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7.

               <p>And if one maketh Title in Aſſize in his plaint where he need not, yet if it be not formall, all ſhall abate; and yet it was abundance, and more then he was compelled to do.

                  <hi>Stamford</hi> and <hi>Walſh</hi> Juſtices, <hi>fol.</hi> 134. It is a Rent; firſt this Covenant and grant is equivalent to reſervation, and is by Indenture, in which the words are the words of both, and taken for the words of him which moſt aptly ſpeaks them, as a Rent upon a Feoffment, <hi>Litl.</hi> 47. is a grant of the Feoffee, and in Judgment of Law ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe words which have ſubſtance, formality, and words there ſhall be taken indifferently; For all parties aſſent, and are privy to the ſpeaking of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="134"/> them.

Reverter for Remainder, So it taketh a word ſpoken by one for the word ſpoken by another, and namely by Indenture, and although it were not a Rent, but a ſum in groſs, yet it extends to it, and to iſſue out of the Land for the Law, becauſe it is ſpetially alleadged the ground of payment of a ſum to be for the Land, and yeerly to be paid, and the one is executory for the other; For (before) <hi>fol.</hi> 71. <hi>if</hi> Land recovered by an elder title, ſhall not pay which hath not the thing which ought to pay, as 15. <hi>E.</hi> 4.4. if he may not have the ancient Pale, he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to make a new, ſo 9. <hi>E</hi> 4 10. if he will not give counſell, the other ſhall ſtay the Annuity, and 39.

So 2. <hi>H.</hi> 7 5. it ſhall diſcend to the heirs of the grantee without naming, becauſe it cometh in reſpect of the Land, which ſhould diſcend to the heir, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:120227:58"/>when the ground of the matter appeareth, the Law ſupplies the fault of the words, becauſe the Law reſpects the ground of the matter and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gawdy.</hi> It is not a rent, <hi>fol.</hi> 136. in 39. <hi>H.</hi> 6.33 all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="136"/> the words ſhall be taken the words of one party, <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt in the Indenture wherefore they are not the words of both, becauſe it eſtops not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party; and an eſtopple diſcends upon the Heir of him which is Heir at the Common Law, becauſe he is Son by the half venter, neither Siſter, or Brother by the entire bloud; and although they agree to have the ſame, yet how, <hi>viz.</hi> as a rent or not, is not parcel of their agreement. So it ſhall not be conſtrued a rent, becauſe words may have a reaſonable conſtruction; otherwiſe in 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4. in the caſe of the Prior of <hi>Bingham,</hi> the Covenant was of a rent which ſhall be intended rent ſervice, the Fine ſaith not <hi>predictum redditum,</hi> but was of five acres and was for the land, and the Grantor was Tenant, ſo holden there to be an annuity; ſo here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morgan,</hi> it is a rent, <hi>f.</hi> 137. <hi>b.</hi> for the aſſent of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="137"/> parties is the chief matter to be conſidered, and not who ſpeaks; for the Leſſor ſhall not have debt for the rent reſerved, unleſs it be a Contract; and it is not a Contract without the aſſent of all; and the words comming out of the mouth of one ſhall be the words of all in the operation of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catline.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe, becauſe words equivalent to a Reſervation; for the Law takes words of ſubſtance, and not uſual equivalent; and words of ſubſtance is uſuall, and the Law regards the effect and ſubſtance more then form; the words
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:120227:59"/>and ſubſtance will ſupply the form, rather then the intent of the parties ſhall be void; as Leſſor and Leſſee for life makes a Feoffment, it ſhall be the Feoffment of the Leſſee, and confirmation of the Leſſor, yet no word of Confirmation (before <hi>fol.</hi> 59.)</p>
               <p>And ſo if a Tenant for years, and the Leſſor make a Feoffment in Fee, this ſhall be taken the Livery and Feoffment of the Leſſor, and ſurrender of the Leſſee; and yet there is nor any word of ſurrender of the Leſſee, but ſhall be ſo taken by the judgemen of Law.</p>
               <p>So a rent granted by Tenants in common, is ſeverall, becauſe eſtates ſeveral; yet words joynt (after <hi>fol.</hi> 161.171. and <hi>Perkins</hi> fol. 22.) ſo <hi>renunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avit communiam,</hi> 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6.35. (after <hi>fol.</hi> 162.) it is a a Leaſe; becauſe where words are equivalent in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="141"/> ſubſtance, the Law will appoint how they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, and in Contracts it is not materiall who ſpeaks the words, if the other agree; for the Law reſpects it, and the words which prove the aſſent and have ſubſtance ſufficient.</p>
               <p>And therefore 21. <hi>H.</hi> 6. if the words of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligee make a Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> the Obligee <hi>vult &amp; concedit,</hi> if the Obligor <hi>ſteterit arbitrio,</hi> yet uſually they are the words of the Obligor for Condition, <hi>Brooks cond. fol.</hi> 58. abridge this contrary.</p>
               <p>So an annuity <hi>pro conſilio,</hi> or a rent for Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tythes, 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4.16. enure as words Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, and a Covenant that the Farmor ſhall not be impeached for waſte, amounts (21. <hi>H.</hi> 6.47.) to hold without impeachment of waſt, 17. <hi>E.</hi> 3.9. award aſſigns land of greater value then the Dower to the Widow, and the ſecond Husband, who granted a rent by the ſame Deed to him, with diſtreſs for the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:120227:59"/>overplus, and the Deed recites this, the Wife Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee after the death of her husband, becauſe the Grant to pay the rent for the overplus of the land, a good reſervation; for otherwiſe he ſhall not be bound contrary before of a Grant for reaſonable Dower, and no mention made that the land was more worth then the Dower, becauſe without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration there, and is a Collateral thing; and ſo words ſhall enure upon Acts between the parties concerning the principal matter, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral matter, differ alſo; the ſumm is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly recited, and the rent ſhall be this ſumm (for the ſentence ſtands good, without words, rent, or farm) where thoſe words ſhall be adjudged void, rather then the certainty expreſſed to be void; as 4.<hi>E.</hi> 4.29. <hi>I.</hi> is obligee to <hi>B. Solvendum</hi> to <hi>I.</hi> yet good, and the Count ſhall be to be paid to <hi>B.</hi> for the intent of the parties makes this good.</p>
               <p>So a Grant of Remainder by the name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the land, a good Grant, notwithſtanding the miſ-terming of the thing, becauſe the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the land appeareth; but by a Grant of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, a Remainder doth not paſs, becauſe the grant is in generalty; and ſo certainty by ſpecial Terms, and by general differs. So where he ſaith, if all rents ſhall be arear, and where the ſaid rent of 37. l. 3. s. 4 d. in certain.</p>
               <p>So words containing generalty, and incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and ſpecialty, and incertainty, differ; to pay 10 s. at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1599, and at the ſame Feaſt of S. <hi>Michaelmas</hi> next enſuing other 10. s. there the ſumm is taken the like, for that it cannot be the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="142"/> ſame if it come after; ſo one word taken for another ſupplies the intent of the parties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Covenant and Grant for not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:120227:60"/>that the Leaſe ſhall be void, is not a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Ramſey, fol.</hi> 133. becauſe it is not ſpoken by him which gives the eſtate; as if two Joynt-Tenants make a Leaſe upon Condition, and that then one Leſſee enters, he ſhall not enter but into one moytie, for that he gave no more; and the words of one, becauſe the Law ſaith, he ſpeaketh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his moytie, ſhall not make this Condition to another which ſpeaks not. And alſo the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſubſequent in time of the <hi>Statute,</hi> which was executed before, for the Demiſe and <hi>habendum</hi> maketh the Leaſe (contrary by <hi>Stamford</hi> and <hi>Walſh.</hi> fol. 135.) for that the parties are ſo agreed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, and the one party and the other aſſents; and therefore all one as if he had reſerved the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional payment, which is called Rent, and is a Condition annexed, for to avoid the Eſtate <hi>Litl.</hi> fol. 70.</p>
               <p>So here, becauſe the ſumm certainly named, be it a Rent, or ſumm in groſs; for it is not requiſite that the Leſſor ſhould ſpeak; but if the words of the Indenture had intendment to avoid the <hi>eſtate,</hi> it ſufficeth, and the words ſhall be taken agreement of every party, and not ſpoken by one party more then another, as proviſoes are, or <hi>ſi contingal;</hi> and all the words of a Deed ſhall take effect at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, becauſe the delivery is at one inſtant; and it hath not ſeveral times proved, by 10. <hi>aſſ.</hi> 15. where ſeveral Deeds delivered at one and the ſame time, the one being a Leaſe for years, the other a Charter upon Condition to have Fee, if diſturbed; before <hi>fol.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>So 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6.35. Leaſe without Impeachment of Waſte, provided, That he makes not voluntary waſte in houſes is Conditional; and waſte lieth
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:120227:60"/>becauſe all made by one Deed; if by two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, yet it is not ſpoken by the Leſſor, more then the Leſſee, but ſhall be taken as an agreement of both the parties.</p>

               <p>It is not a Condition by <hi>Brooks,</hi> becauſe it is not reſtrictive and compulſarie, as are <hi>Ita quod non</hi> if the Leſſee doth ſuch an Act, or if it happens, or proviſo; but a proviſo alwaies maketh not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as in <hi>Dockwraies</hi> caſe, 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8.15. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe voluntary; for Leeſſee without words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſary of the Leſſor, Covenants and Grants, That he will remove, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by <hi>Catlyn,</hi> fol. 142. is a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe it implies the intent of the parties to be Conditional, yet it hath not the uſual words as a Feoffment, to pay 20. s. or inſtruct his Son in ſuch an Art.</p>
               <p>For it is a Condition, becauſe the parties pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch intent. So proviſo, That the Leſſee make ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p>So here, it ſhall enure as a Condition, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever manner it be called, it ſhall enure as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Leaſee becauſe it was made at the time when the Leaſe began.</p>

               <p>So here, the party uſes this as a Demiſe of the Land, and not as a Grant of the Reverſion; for the Reyerſion of the Land compriſeth the Land, as <hi>Litl.</hi> fol. 106. after <hi>fol.</hi> 161. a releaſe of all the land to him in Reverſion, is good.</p>
               <p>So 5. <hi>H.</hi> 5.8. A Leaſe for years, and after a grant of the rent, this changes the reverſion.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Litl.</hi> fol. 150. recovery of the land againſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life, will diveſt the reverſion.</p>

So extenders ſhall not pay preſently according to the words of <hi>Acton, Burnel,</hi> which ought to anſwer preſently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſhall be debtors preſently with the duty, and chargeable with the payment, and daies payable of the rent, or Revenues receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>So by Expoſition it ſeems againſt the Text of the <hi>Statute,</hi> and is not, becauſe the intent of the makers guides them to it.</p>
               <p>Of the part of the Defendant it was argued, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="206"/> That the Action ſhall be ſued there in <hi>Wales,</hi> where the receipt is alleadged, although that <hi>Wales</hi> is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>England,</hi> by 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. becauſe by the ſame <hi>Statute, Wales</hi> is divided into 12. Counties, and by 34. and 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. four Juſtices are appointed for <hi>wales, viz.</hi> one for every three Counties, and hold plea of all things within their circuit, and one ſeal appointed for every circuit, and all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſuable there by the words of the <hi>Statute.</hi> And when the <hi>Statute</hi> appoints place, order, and form of ſuits, and before what perſon, it ſhall not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>As by <hi>W.</hi> 2. cap 11. an Accomptant found in Arrearages, ſhall be impriſoned in the next Goal, although it be in another County, 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. (before <hi>fol.</hi> 17.)</p>
               <p>So by <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. cap. 3. Second deliverance ſhall be ſued out of the ſame Court, where the firſt Replevin was granted, and not elſewhere.</p>
               <p>So 31. <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 12. Error in the Exchequer ſhall be corrected before the Chancellor and Treaſurer, and therefore not before others.</p>
               <p>So an Affirmative, becauſe general, implies a Negative excluſively; ſo all Actions ſhall be ſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:120227:72"/>in <hi>Wales,</hi> and not elſewhere, is implied here, as by <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. he ſhall vouch in <hi>Quo die deforceat,</hi> as if he were Tenant, and included, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and therefore ſhall not vouch <hi>in ſcire facias,</hi> where it is the firſt Writ, becauſe he cannot vouch there, (before <hi>fo.</hi> 113)</p>
               <p>So the iſſue in Tail ſhall not be remitted, becauſe he hath the uſe as a purchaſer, by 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the <hi>Statute</hi> of 27. executes the poſſeſſion in the ſame manner as he had the uſe; which implies, and not in any other Mannors, (before <hi>fol.</hi> 114.) So by 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Leaſes made by <hi>Abbots</hi> after this <hi>Stat.</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged void, when Abbies came after to the King by diſſolution, becauſe the <hi>Statute</hi> ſaith, That the King ſhall have it as it was then, which implies a Negative, and therefore the King ſhall not have them now in Reverſion by making of ſuch Leaſes, or before he hath them in poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>On the part of the Plaintiff it was argued to the contrary. And they agreed to the caſes of voucher in a <hi>Quod ei deforceat</hi> of the Execution of the uſe, and of the committing of an accomptant to the next Gaol; for where an Act maketh a new thing Affirmative, and gives to them Authority to do that which they could not before, there they ſhall be in the order limited by the <hi>Statute,</hi> and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; and at the Common Law there was not any voucher by the demandant, nor any coming to the land by the uſe, nor any power given to Auditors, to commit an Accomptant to priſon; and therefore there, that which is limited by ſuch <hi>Stat.</hi> ought to be purſued accordingly; but where the Action, which was before at the Common Law, is given by any <hi>Statute</hi> in any caſe where it did not lie before, there this Action is ſuable in all Courts,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:120227:72"/>therefore uſed by the Common Law before, if there are not expreſs words to reſtrain it; for where one Act affirms a former before, there the laſt Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative deſtroies not the firſt, nor takes any thing from the Jurisdiction of the firſt, but declares That they have power.</p>
               <p>So 34. and 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. hereby the Affirmative takes not away the Jurisdiction of other Courts given to them, by 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. for uniting <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That the executor is an Aſſignee in Law, to whom the Leaſe ought to be made, and ſo the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of an executor by the Common Law.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Admitting that the word Aſſignee were void, or omitted out of the deed, yet this ſhall be made to the executor; for that the intent was ſuch, which ſhall be performed where the words could not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baber</hi> and <hi>Wray,</hi> argued for the Defendant, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="286"/> it is abridged by <hi>Aſh, fol.</hi> 50. <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="287"/> apprentice for the Plaintiff.

And if the words thereof have a double ſenſe, that which is for the benefit of the Grantee ſhall be taken; then the word <hi>[Aſſigned]</hi> here ſhall be drawn to ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:120227:92"/>ſenſe for the avail of the Grantee. And if the word <hi>[Aſſignee]</hi> as the Councel on the part of the Defendant would have it applied to a limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſenſe of an <hi>Habendum</hi> to him and his Aſſignes for 21. years, it is void and conveys no benefit to the Grantee; becauſe if I Leaſe to <hi>A.</hi> for 21. years, and his Aſſignes ſhall have this as largely as I do veſt this Leaſe in him, and his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes; becauſe the Law gives power to him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign it to another.</p>
               <p>Aſſignee hath two ſenſes; in the one it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the perſon to whom the thing granted or given, ſhall be afterwards conveyed by him which hath the thing; as the Leſſor Grants to the Leſſee for years, That he or his Aſſignes ſhall have twenty Carts of Wood annually in ſuch a Wood, Aſſignee there hath the ſenſe of the perſon to whom he ſhall Aſſign the Leaſe.</p>
               <p>So one warrants Land to the Feoffee, his Heirs, and aſſignes, there the ſecond Feoffee ſhal vouch. So I ſell a Horſe upon Condition, That if I pay 40 s. to him, or his Aſſignees, that I ſhall have the horſe again, Aſſignee there is he to whom he grants the horſe; but ſuch Aſſignee is not in our caſe, becauſe he hath not any eſtate firſt made, and ſuch a one is Aſſignee after the thing granted; in the ſecond it contains the perſon to whom the thing which is to be made, and is not made, ſhall be made: as I am bound to make a Feoffment, or give a horſe to you, or your Aſſignee, there the Aſſignee is ſuch a perſon which you ſhall name to me to receive; and the Aſſignee in this ſenſe is before the things done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="288"/> or granted, and Aſſignes in this ſenſe is in the firſt alſo.</p>
               <p>But with this in the firſt ſenſe, we have not to do
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:120227:92"/>here; there are Aſſignes in Deed, and Law; in Deed, where you name ſuch a one, to whom I ſhall make the Feoffment, or give the horſe; in Law where you name no man to receive, then the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor ſhall have it, becauſe the Law ſaith, That they are your Aſſignes to ſuch purpoſe, and preſent your perſon, as to receive any Chattels real or perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>So 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8 2. Executor is an Aſſignee in Law to take a Rental, where the Leſſee bound himſelf to deliver it to the Leſſor, or his Aſſignes at the end of the Term, a true rental, and the Leſſor made no Aſſignee, he is an ill expounder which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the Text. And therefore here [and] the Copulative ſhall be taken for [or] the Disjunctive; for otherwiſe the ſenſe will be abſurd, that the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee if he had been alive at the end of the firſt Leaſe, ſhould not take a new Leaſe until he names his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſignee; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="289"/> or impoſſible, as joyning his aſſignee in law with him, becauſe he cannot have an Executor in his life.</p>
               <p>So in our Law, a copulative is taken as a disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and a disjunctive as a copulative for to make words to ſtand with reaſon, and with the intent of the parties; as the Obligee ſhall pay 10. l. if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoff not him, or his Heirs, when he cometh to <hi>I.</hi> intends (yet words disjunctive) in ſenſe, That he ſhall infeoff him if he be living; and if dead, then his Heirs; becauſe he cannot have an Heir during his life; ſo here a Covenant to make a Leaſe at a time to come to him and his Aſſignes Copulatively, ſhall be taken disjunctively. viz. to him if he be alive, and to his Aſſignes if he be dead.</p>
               <p>So (4. <hi>Mar.</hi> before 171.) A. and B. Grants a Rent

Admitting that the word <hi>[Aſſignee]</hi> was void, or omitted out of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; yet this Leaſe here ſhall be made to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, for that the intent which is the chief thing to be conſidered in every agreement, was ſuch; which ſhall be performed ſo near as may be, or the words ſhall not be effectual; and the chief effect of the agreement, was the eſtate which ſhould be made, not the perſon to whom: but if the Tenant bind himſelf, and Covenant to do corporall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Lord, he cannot to the Heir or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, becauſe it muſt be done to the body of the Lord; and if I periſh, the thing alſo periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

And it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite alwaies, that in agreements every thing ought to be performed according to the words; for if the Mortgagee accept of another thing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, good, (<hi>Litl. f.</hi> 79.) So if the Obligee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to the place at the day appointed to receive his ſumm, he hath not loſt it. 7. <hi>E.</hi> 4.4. but 19. <hi>H.</hi> 8, 12, if the Obligee ſue for the penalty, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:120227:94"/>ought to ſhew that he was ready at the day and place, and ſay that he is yet ready.

               <p>The good will, and fraternal love wich he hath to his bloud, and his brothers which is the neareſt degree of bloud after Parents and iſſues, good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations here; and ſo it ſeems by the better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in 20. <hi>H.</hi> 7.10. but is not there adjudged, and they that joyn in bloud by nature, joyn in love; and therefore if the youngeſt enter after the death of the Father, the elder ſhall have no action againſt him,

               <p>Fourth Conſideration.</p>

               <p>Good and ſufficient Conſideration, raiſeth an Uſe without Deed; ſo a Deed raiſes Uſes if there be any Conſideration; for it is made to ſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or otherwiſe ſhould be void, becauſe you ſhall not have an action of Covenant here, becauſe an action of Covenant lieth upon a Covenant only in the preter, or future Tenſe, and not in the preſent Tenſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Contract, or Agreement for Lands, or Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, is by the Law, Firſt, by Writing; Secondly, by Words.</p>
               <p>Firſt, An agreement by writing, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, is not <hi>Nudum;</hi> becauſe a man hath great conſideration, and deliberation in paſſing things by Deed; and the writing, his ſealing, and delivery of it, ſignifies fully his will, is ſufficient conſideration, that Land ſhall paſs as his will is, and ſhall bind the party without thinking what cauſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:120227:98"/>he hath to do it. Secondly, an Agreement by word without conſideration, is <hi>Nudum,</hi> and binds not; becauſe words paſſes from a man ſuddenly, and without adviſement many times, as 17 <hi>E.</hi> 4.4. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="309"/> promiſe to give you 20. l. for to make your ſale of new, it is <hi>Nudum pactum;</hi> if it be by Deed, you may have Action of Debt upon this Deed, and the Conſideration there is not examinable, and the cauſe of the Deed is not inquirable; for every Deed imports in it ſelf a Conſideration without the will of the party which makes the Deed.

Alſo Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not of great eſtimation, but ſhew the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Subjects, and are made at their requeſts for whom they are granted; and many of the ſaid Commiſſions and Leaſes were limited, That the Grantee ſhould make to the owners of Lands in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> uſed for the digging of Tin before the ſaid Charter, proves by the words themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> That for the amendment of our Stannaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other words in the Charter; and albeit the King had ſome profit of Tin, or Lead in ſome places, as a toll diſh of Oar, that was not in reſpect of the intereſt the King had, but for the bearing of the Charges of Officers, as he had of Merchants of ſome part of their Marchandizes, for the ſearchers, Controller and Waigher, becauſe he appointed Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>By thoſe of the Earls Councel it was ſaid, That if the Law were ſuch that the Mines of Copper in the lands of Subjects, ſhall be the Kings by his Prerogative; yet here thoſe Mines and Oar in queſtion, paſs to the Earl by the Letters Pattents of King <hi>Philip,</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> For as to the firſt Plea, they take that the vain wherein the ſaid five hundred thouſand weight of Copper was digged, could not be called a Mine at the time of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Pattents granted, nor paſs by the name of

               <p>The King Rents the firſt Grant by his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and ſaith, <hi>Ex certa ſcientia,</hi> (as we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) concludes not the King to ſay that ſuch grant was made by <hi>Huſſey,</hi> 9. <hi>H.</hi> 72.

               <p>The third point argued by the Queens Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</p>
               <p>Firſt by the Kings Grant <hi>Ex mero motu, certa ſcientia,</hi> and <hi>gratia speciali,</hi> Mines of Gold and Silver, or other Mines Royal, will not paſs, although that it appeareth, that it was hidden at the time, and appeareth afterwards; otherwiſe of baſe Mines, for thoſe paſs, but not Mines Royal which are Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things to the Soil, as are hidden Treaſure, which paſſeth not by the gift of the King; nor <hi>Wreck, Straies, Waifs,</hi> &amp;c. paſſe not; nor do liberties paſs by the Grant of a Mannor. As the King gives a mannor within a Forreſt which eſcheats to him; yet the Donee may not cut his woods within it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licence of the Juſtice of the Forreſt; and the Mannor remains ſubject to the Paſture of Deer; and wild beaſts of the Forreſt; and ſo thing col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral to the Soil, as are things of <hi>Prerogative</hi> and liberty, paſs not by the gift of the Soil. So Livery to the Heir gives not Right.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:120227:102"/>
               <p> The King aſſignes Dower to his Mother; but the King ſhall aſſign it by his Prerogative, without the Clauſe (<hi>de ſalva</hi> to the wife her Dower, by the King <hi>aſſignanda</hi>) and upon this reaſon he put the caſe of 31.

The King ſhall have all, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſentment of the eldeſt and middle Siſter by his Prerogative, becauſe entire, and his Prerogative takes away the elder and middle Siſters to preſent. And the King hath three preſentments in the Wards right; and it paſſeth by his Pattent; but that to which the King is intituled by his Prerogative, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not without expreſs mention. A Pattent <hi>Ex gratia speciali,</hi> &amp;c. ſhall be taken favourably to the Pattentee, <hi>viz.</hi> as to the thing expreſſed in the Pattent, which the words ſhew to be intended to paſs; but this will not make another thing to paſs not expreſſed or ſhewed to be intended by the words of the Pattent to paſs. The King had the ſecret Mine of Copper mixt with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Land given by his anceſtors to the <hi>Prior</hi> of <hi>Wenlock,</hi> and there it paſſeth not by the Grant of the Soil, <hi>Ex mero motu,</hi> &amp;c. yet it was of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the King, and Religious favored, <hi>Fitzh. nat. br.</hi> 332.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the Kings Grant <hi>De omnibus &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis Mineris ex certa ſcientia,</hi> &amp;c. Mines Royal, <hi>viz.</hi> of Gold and Silver, or of baſe mettal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it Gold or Silver, paſſes not; becauſe the King hath them <hi>Ratione Cornnae,</hi> not of the land, and becauſe appropriate to his Crown, paſſeth not without ſpecial words; baſe Mines here, as thoſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:120227:103"/>which conſiſt onely of baſe ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> Copper, Tin, Lead Iron, or Coles, and not having in them Gold or Silver, and Patentees ſhall have things fit for Subjects; yet the terms of the Pattent compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend things annexd to the Crown or of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; but they ſhall be conſtrued to paſs the things of the baſeſt degree, 22. aſſ. pl. The King Grants to the maſter of S. <hi>Leonard, Omnia catella tenentium ſuorum Feloniae qualiter cun<expan>

               <p>So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="334"/> the Kings Grant of the Return of all manner of Writs, the Grantee ſhall not have the Return of ſummons of the Exchequer; becauſe it concerneth the King himſelf there.</p>
               <p>So 2. R. 3.4. 2. H. 7.7. The Kings Grantee of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciaments of his Tenants, ſhall not have the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciament of his Tenant which holdeth of him, and another; becauſe it is before other Tenants, as well as my Tenant.</p>
               <p>Charters of the King taken according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intent, and other things which have not common intent, ſhall not paſs from the King by his Charters. And therefore 3.

               <p>So 9. H. 6.56. (before fol. 243.) The Grantee of the King with Warranty, ſhall not have in value, without preciſe words, but he may rebutt. So 2. H.

               <p>So 43. E. 3. aſſ pl. 15. The King Grants to his eldeſt Son the <hi>Dutchie</hi> of <hi>Cornwall, cum omnibus Wardis, Maritagiis,</hi> &amp;c. And one which held of the <hi>Dutchie</hi> by Knights Service, and which held alſo of one which was in Ward, becauſe of Ward by Knights Service, dieth, his Heir within age, the Prince ſhall not have the Wardſhip of him, but the King; becauſe a thing pertaining to the Crown paſſeth not without ſpecial words. So the King ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a County Palatine, and giveth to another, and <hi>Jura Regalia,</hi> and that Pleas within the County ſhall be determined there; yet he himſelf ſhall ſue at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> his actions ariſing within the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Palatine, as 3.

               <p>So an Abbot by the Kings Grant made to him for the amortizing of Land, or Tenements, may not purchaſe an Advowſon holden of the King <hi>in Capite:</hi> and this caſe by <hi>Wray,</hi> differs from the caſe in 41. aſſ. pl. 19.

E. 3. he might not appropriate an Advowſon holden of the King by licence to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:120227:104"/>So 1. H. 7 23 and 26. A ſanctuary for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall not be without ſpeciall Words, <hi>Ex mer<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

But here when he hath 10. acres, and Deviſes all his Lands, they are ſatisfied in paſſing of the 10. acres; and there is no meaning by the words for the land pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed after the Will; becauſe the thing is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med certainly, as the Mannor of Dale, or White-acre. Alſo he may not Deviſe the 12. acres, becauſe by <hi>Dier</hi> the <hi>Statute</hi> 32. and 34. H. 8. cap. 1. and 5. intend that the Deviſor ſhall be ſeized at the time
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:120227:106"/>of the making of the will, becauſe it ſpeaks of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Lands which he may Deviſe, and here he hath not thoſe at the time of the Deviſe. <hi>Quaere</hi> of the caſe where he Deviſes by ſpecial name, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purchaſes it, becauſe of the word <hi>[having.]</hi>

                  <hi>Manwood</hi> for the Defendant. Becauſe it is more conſonant to the will of the Deviſor, and reaſon, That the effect ſhall take place, and the form periſh, rather then both ſhould periſh together; as Deviſee for life (the Remainder over) dies in the life time of the Deviſor, it is a good Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſhall have the immediate poſſeſſion which is the effect; yet the form was for to have by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder. So if a Dean die, or a woman Covert taketh another husband before their Deviſor dies, yet they are eſpecially named; Land ſhall veſt in the new Dean and his Succeſſors, and in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which is now the wiſe of another, according to the intent, becauſe it cannot according to the words; and if the intent of a man in Conditions ſhall be performed, as 4. H. 7. by <hi>Joy,</hi> he ought to infeoff the ſurvivor and his heirs onely where the other dieth <hi>a fortiori;</hi> the intent in Wils ſhall be obſerved where the words cannot, and the effect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="345"/> here is that the Heir ſhall have the Land, and it is the form of the limitation, that he ſhall have it by diſcent, 21. R. 2. Remainder <hi>Eccleſiae-Sancti Andreae</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> good.

               <p>
                  <hi>Lovelas,</hi> and all the Juſtices beſides <hi>Walſh,</hi> to the contrary. For by the death of the Deviſee, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe is countermanded, for that the Deviſee is not

                  <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> when the Deviſe took effect; and in all gifts, be they by Deviſe or otherwiſe, there ought to be a Donee in <hi>eſſe</hi> capable when the thing ought to veſt, or otherwiſe the gift is void, and the word Heirs limits the eſtate, and not the perſons which ſhall take, and enables the Deviſee, as well to alien, as to permit it of Diſcent; for a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the Heir is but a thing ſubſequent to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of Fee-ſimple firſt veſted in the Deviſee, and a thing at his pleaſure. And things of ſequel which enſue if the eſtate had been veſted firſt, (as are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Dower, Eſcheat) are not good cauſes to make things veſt in others then thoſe to whom limited. And therefore the heir ſhall not have the land here no more then the woman ſhall have dower, or Lord Eſcheat if he had died without heir, which ſhould be ſo if it had veſted in the Deviſee. And therefore if a man Deviſe a Leaſe or goods to I. S. which dies, and afterwards the Deviſor dies, the Executor of <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall not have them.</p>
               <p>The ſpeaking to the Son of the Deviſee, That he ſhall be his heir, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is void, for that the <hi>Statutes</hi> of 32. and 34. H. 8. gives licence and authority to every man to Deviſe his Lands by his laſt Will and Teſtament in writing, and thoſe are ſufficient in themſelves for to make the thing deviſed paſs, and not regard words without writing, by all the Juſtices; but if he had publiſhed the Teſtament of new, the Deviſee ſhould have the 12. acres in this caſe, for that it had been as it were a new Teſtament but not his heirs.</p>

So Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, after the year and day, was peremptory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Fine or Recovery in a Writ of Right Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and not Executed, as is a Fine <hi>ſur Conuſans de droit</hi> and Render. 7. <hi>E.</hi> 3.335.

But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="360"/> a woman Covert was bound to make Claim by the Common Law, becauſe ſhe is not mentioned in any of the Acts, and hath a Husband which may make Claim for her.

And if the Father Diſſeiſee dyeth within a year and day after the Fine Levied, before the Statute of Nonclaim, his Heir within age, he need not make Claim, becauſe he is not bound where the right diſcends to him, more then he is when he hath a preſent right when the Fine was levied; nor Infant in Remainder or Reverſion, is not bound by the Nonclaim of the particular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

But Infants are bound by Laches for a Title, &amp; favoured for the Inheritance, as Doctor and Student, 148. An Infant ſhall be bound by Ceſſavit or Waſte, becauſe an injury done by his Act, and he ſhall purchaſe, and the Law will preſume if he hath policy to get a thing, that he hath reaſon to defend himſelf: So if an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Lord enter not for Mortmain within the year, or before a Villain hath ſold, becauſe he had but Title to the thing, that it was never in him. But Doctor and Student, 29. and 27. Aſſiſes, 32. Laches of Entry upon Diſcent or Warranty, binds not an Infant, becauſe they have favour for Inheritance,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:120227:112"/>for Waife, Stray, Wreck, or for Goods taken from them, and offered to Images, or taken by Enemies, and not retaken before the Sun ſets; or ſold in a Market Overt, or Acts an Infant as Executor, 35. <hi>E.</hi> 3.45. or as King, before 213 or for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as an Obligation for meat, and drink, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="365"/> and Student. 104. The Common Law is the foundation of this Act of 4.<hi>H.</hi> 7. and if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dies within a year after the Fine, his Heir In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is at large, (fol. 372. otherwiſe,) &amp; the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which may happen ſometimes within five years are to be conſidered, as thoſe which are at the time of the Fine or right then: And becauſe that the <hi>Statute</hi> provides for the Infant in the exception, and in the Fine, it will not be amiſs in the middeſt: And if one which hath a future right dies within five years his Heir within age, ſhall have five, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> he which hath a preſent right (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="366"/> here) becauſe it is of greater eſtimation then a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If a ſtranger to a Fine cometh of Non-ſane memory, or is in priſon the third year after Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations made, and after the five years cometh of Sane memory, or out of priſon, he ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, becauſe conſtrained and acts involuntary; but if he or ſhe taketh Husband, or go beyond Sea in the third year, and after five years is diſcovert, or within the Land, he ſhall be bound, becauſe Acts voluntary. An Expounder which adheres only to the Letter of the <hi>Statute</hi> of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reaſonable ſence, will admit many abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as by the Letter of the <hi>Statute;</hi> if an Infant which hath preſent right &amp; is excepted, dies within age, his Unkle being his Heir and of full age ſhall be barred. So if an Infant by Entry within age avoyd the Fine, &amp; after full age, permit the Conuſee
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:120227:112"/>to be for five years in poſſeſſion without Claim, he ſhall be barred by the Letter, which ſaith that he ſhall take Action or Entry within five years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter full age. So an Infant being Diſeiſee in his Mothers belly when the Fine was Levied, is not accepted by the Letter of the Act (becauſe his age is accounted from the time of his birth,) by intent of the Act here, for every thing which is within the intent of the makers of the Act, although that it be not within the Letter and intent alſo; and of thoſe exceptions, the Letter binds none to five years after full age, which were within age when the Fine was Levied and ingroſſed, and many years may be between the one and the other; yet he that is born after the Fine levied, and is within age when it is ingroſſed, goeth not at large, but is bound to five years after full age, as well as he which was born an Infant when the Fine was levied and ingroſſed: And if the Diſſeiſee at full age when the Fine is levied, die, before the Proclamations, his Heir within age then, and when all the years paſs, is bound by the Letter, becauſe the Letter excepts him which hath right when the Fine is levied.

               <p>Two Joint-Tenants Diſſeiſes, the one within <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="367"/> age, the Diſſeiſor levies a Fine, four years paſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Proclamations, he of full age dies, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſhall have other five years after his full age for
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:120227:113"/>all, by <hi>Bendlos,</hi> and ſeverall five years ſhall be for ſeverall Titles. As <hi>A.</hi> diſſeiſeth, a woman ſole taketh her to wife and have Iſſue, <hi>A.</hi> is diſſeiſed and dies after a Fine levied by the Diſſeiſor, and before the Proclamations, the Iſſue being of full age, after the Mother dies, the fifth year paſſe, the Iſſue is bound as Heir to his Father; becauſe in this reſpect, he hath but five years together. But as Heir to the Mother he ſhall have five years to be accounted from the death of the Father; for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is the ſelf-ſame Land, he hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall rights, the one the laſt as Heir to his Father, and th'other the firſt right as Heir to his Mother, And in reſpect of them hath ſeverall times; So the Husband maketh a Feoffment of the Land of his Wife, upon the condition which is broken, the Feoffee levies a Fine, the Husband dies in the fourth year, after Proclamations having Iſſue by the Wife, after the Wife dies, and five years paſſe; the Heir is barred to enter as Heir to the Father for the Condition, but ſhall have five years from the death of his Father as Heir to his Mother for her right, for the cauſe aforeſaid, by <hi>Saunders.

And the <hi>Statute</hi> which Ouſts Nonclaim, was to the univerſall trouble of all the Realm; for the avoyding whereof, and to make Fines to have their antient force, the Act of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. was made; and the Preamble of it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, becauſe it is a Key to open the minds of the Makers of the Act, and the miſchiefs that they intended to remedy; and the preamble ſhews that the Makers of the Act were of Opinion, that Fines ought to be of greater force for to avoid contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then they were before the <hi>Statute</hi> of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and now is uſed to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> to the univerſall trouble of the Kings Subjects, and therefore they were Enemies to former rights, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſtirred up many Suits, and made the Purview ſtrongly againſt it, <hi>Et lex ſi prospiciat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jori <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="370"/> parti retilis eſt.</hi> All Infants are bound by the generall Purview which containeth them in the Exceptions: As an Infant levies a Fine, Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations paſs, he ſhall not have error; yet within age, for no Infant is excepted: But he that is not Party to the Fine by <hi>Southcot</hi> and <hi>Walſh,</hi> he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted out of the generall Purview, in the intent of the Makers of the Act. And <hi>Stowell</hi> the Heir is not within the Purview nor Exception of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> for that he had not right at the time of the Fine levied; but then the right reſted in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor which was diſſeiſed; for the Exception is always an exemption of that which is contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the generall words, otherwiſe could not be excepted: As a Feoffment of a Mannor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch an Acre which is not parcell of it, or a Leaſe of all Lands of the part of the Father, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Lands of the part of the Mother, is a void ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, becauſe this exception was not in the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:120227:114"/>Feoffment, nor Demiſe, or right, or not right, is not the matter; but claim, or Nonclaim within five years is the matter where a Fine is pleaded to conclude any.

               <p>
                  <hi>Catline,</hi> a Writ of deceit by the Lord in ancient Demeaſne made 20. years after Proclamation upon a Fine Levyed by his Tenant, ſhall make void the Fine, and the Tenant ſhall be reſtored to the land, becauſe he claims ſigniory, and ſervices out of the Land, and no right to the Land when the Fine was levyed, and therefore is out of the purview which extends not from whom he claims, or had right in poſſeſſion, Reverſion, or Remainder to the thing compriſed within the Fine, when the Fine was Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed upon matter riſing before. The firſt ſaving giveth five years after proclamation to thoſe which have right, and their Heirs, with a Condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="371"/> to it, viz. ſo that they purſue their Title, Claim. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within five years after Proclamations; and as the ſaving is general to all Heirs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they have their imperfections of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, Inſanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So is the Condition general, and extends to all Heirs whatſoever they are; and this was the cauſe of the Judgement; for otherwiſe the ſaving ſhall be for all heirs, and the <hi>[So]</hi> ſhall be of all Heirs within age, and then the <hi>[So]</hi> is not ſo large as the ſaving. And ſo the Heir within age is bound to the Condition of the firſt ſaving, as well as he is ſaved in the ſame, becauſe general tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity is more favored then an Infant, and no time ſhall be gained by expoſition or equity, beyond the words of the act, where the Act as here, to ſtrains all men to a time certain for the common
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:120227:114"/>tranquillity of the people; and Infants had been bound by the general purview of 32. H. 8. c. 2. if they had not been excepted there: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if one of the Terms limited by 4. H. 7. be adjourned (becauſe the <hi>Statute</hi> ſaith, then next enſuing) all the Proclamations before are void, until the <hi>Statute</hi> of 1. <hi>Mar.</hi> cap. 7. <hi>Raſtall, Fines,</hi> 12. becauſe time limited by the act, ought to be purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and once attached in part, ought to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. So the 5. County upon Exigent ought to be the next to the fourth, or it is diſcontinuance, and Allocatur <hi>Comitatus</hi> ſhall not aid, but is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. And therefore an Infant at the Common law ſhall be bound to year and day (otherwiſe <hi>f.</hi> 365.) where by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 4. H. 7. The five years Commence in the father, being of full age, Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim within the time limited by the Common Law, ſhall loſe right, and infancy there ſhall not aid the party, as 7. H. 6.32. Nonclaim by the Lord of his villain by a year and day, which hath fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ancient Demeaſne. So 15. E. 4. 6. Nonclaim of liberties before Juſtices in Eire.

               <p>The ſecond ſaving giveth new 5. years to other perſons, and hore <hi>Stowel</hi> is the ſame perſon which had five years with his anceſtor by the firſt ſaving, becauſe the ſaving, and the <hi>[ſo]</hi> is in the Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the word <hi>[others]</hi> is excluſive of thoſe compriſed in the firſt ſaving, and the exception. And becauſe he is heir, and ſo within the firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, he is excluded out of the ſecond ſaving by the word <hi>[other],</hi> by <hi>Walſh</hi> and others; if a Tenant for the life of another, the Remainder to B, for his life, the Remainder to A. in Fee is Diſſeiſed, the Diſſeiſor levies a Fine, and five years paſs after proclamations, if he for whoſe life and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder for life dies, he ſhall have new five years, becauſe it is another eſtate, and the firſt remains to him; but by <hi>Weſton</hi> and <hi>Catline</hi> otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not another perſon; alſo this right which firſt Diſcends to <hi>Stowell</hi> here, is not ſuch a right as the <hi>Statute</hi> intends to give new five years by the ſecond ſaving for a new right, for it was once right in the Anceſtor, and given to him before. And the word [firſt] is of great purpoſe put into the act, and this word [joyn] as it ought to every of the words ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, <hi>viz.</hi> Accrue, Remain, Diſcend, or Come, excludes <hi>Stowel</hi> of the benefit of the ſecond ſaving, and 1. R. 2. cap 7. touching Fines hath all the words of 4. H. 7. touching the purview and body of the Act, but the word [Firſt] which is added to 4. H. 7. as a thing thought very neceſſary, and ſo he that wil take benefit of the ſecond ſaving, ought to prove
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:120227:115"/>four things, 1. That he is another perſon. Secondly, That the right firſt came to him. Thirdly, and that it came after the Fine ingroſſed, and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations made. Fourthly, That his right is before the Fine levyed, as where right or Title ſhall firſt accrue. And therefore if the elder brother be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed when the Father died ſeiſed, and the youngeſt is Diſſeiſed at the levying of the Fine with Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and five years paſs, and after is deraigned, he ſhall be aided by the ſecond ſaving for the cauſe aforeſaid. So if the Diſſeſor of a Mortgagee levies a Fine with Proclamations, &amp; five years paſs, &amp; after the Mortgagor pay or tender the Money, he ſhall have years after his payment or tender, becauſe his Title firſt accrued after the Proclamations by the payment or tender by matter before, <hi>viz.</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; <hi>Plowden</hi> ſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ems, that he is at large, and not bound to five years, becauſe at the time of the Fine levied no wrong was done to him, nor to the eſtate which he claims. So a husband levies a Fine with Proclamations, and after the five years paſt dies, and from thence by this ſecond ſaving, his wife ſhall have five years to ſue out her Writ of Dowe<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for her Title accrued by the death of her husband, upon cauſe before the Fine, viz. their inter-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and ſeiſin of her husband, by <hi>Plowden</hi> ſhe is at large and not bound to five years, becauſe it was a real wrong done to her at the time of the Fine, or before, becauſe her Title accrued after the Fine, viz. by the death of her husband. So Tenant ceſs one year before the Fine, and another year after the Proclamations, the Lord is at large to have his ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavit 20. years after, for it is not within the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the Act, becauſe he had not Title at the time of the levying of the Fine; but it accrued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:120227:116"/>viz. to the end of the two years where firſt it ſhould remain as to the Donee, &amp; to his heirs Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males of his body (Remainder to his Son in Fee) Levy a Fine with Proclamations, and die, then the Son ſhall have five years. So Tenant for life, Remainder in Fee Levies a Fine with Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and dies, then the Son ſhall have five years. So Tenant for life, Remainder in Fee is Deſſeiſed, the Diſſeiſor Levies a Fine, and five years paſs, and Tenant for life dies, he in Remainder ſhall have new five years: Tenant for life, and Feoffee Levies a Fine, five years paſs, entry for Forfeiture is gone; but there by <hi>Walſh</hi> he ſhall have a Formedon after the death of the Tenant for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="374"/> life if he ſues it within five years, (by <hi>Catline</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) becauſe his right accrues not firſt, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after the death of the Tenant for life, becauſe he might have entred before, and therefore is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the benefit of the ſecond ſaving. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for years by <hi>Statute,</hi> or <hi>Elegit,</hi> is ouſted, and a Fine with Proclamations levied, and five years paſs now, none may enter, nor he in Reverſion, nor particular Tenant, and ſhall not be aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſecond ſaving, for both might have entred before the Proclamations paſs, becauſe they all are compriſed in the firſt ſaving; and therefore he in Reverſion ſhall not have years after the Term end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as he ſhall have where the particular eſtate was Free-hold, and a Termor is bound by this <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of 4.

But here it is not double, becauſe it is not a new attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but a Confirmation: And becauſe he cannot plead the Confirmation without the thing that was Confirmed. Alſo the Recitall and Confirmation by the Statute is not taken, but <hi>pro ut:</hi> And alſo the recitall being falſe, ſhall be intended to be upon Information: And therefore an averment lies againſt this recitall.

               <p>Leaſes by word, by Deed Poll, by Indenture, are to be conſidered how they ſhall enure: As if a Leaſe be made by words, without Deed of Lands by one that hath ſee ſimple for one and twenty years to commence preſently, rendring a rent, and after the ſame day ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a new Leaſe by Paroll to another for the ſame terme, or for a leſſor terme, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Leaſe is void, although that the firſt Leſſee ſurrenders or forfeits; becauſe at the time of the firſt Leaſe he hath not but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and no intereſt in him to contract for the poſſeſſion: And he that will by contract make another poſſeſſor of the thing, ought to be proprietor of the ſame himſelf: As if one ſells a Horſe upon condition that the Vendee ſhall pay him forty ſhillings at Eaſter, and after he ſells the Horſe to a ſtranger, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt Vendee payes not the forty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings at Eaſter, and the Vendor reſeiſeth the Horſe, the ſecond Vendee ſhall not have the Horſe, becauſe the Vendor had him not at the time of the ſale; the Condition only inables him not to contract for the property and poſſeſſion, which he then had not; but if the Leſſee for one and twenty years be, and the Leſſor the ſame day grant the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by Deed for twenty one years to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:120227:129"/>preſently, it is good with Attournment and he ſhall have the Reverſion during the firſt Leaſe, and the Rent as incident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, becauſe it is another thing then the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: So a Leaſe by word for years to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence after the firſt year, is good, becauſe it is of another thing then the firſt Leſſee had, becauſe the ſecond Leſſee is to have the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion after the firſt poſſeſſion and intereſt expired. A man leaſes for one and twenty years in poſſeſſion, and preſently maks a Leaſe of it for one and thirty years by word, this is good for the laſt ten years, and Executory for it, for a Leaſe for years is Executory, and ſeverall for every yeare and day, and is as to execution as ſeverall contracts: And therefore ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract may be good in part, and void in part. So if he Leaſes for 21. years, to commence 10. years after, and he maketh a Leaſe for 31. years to commence preſently, it is good for the firſt 10. years, and void for the laſt 21. years, for that he had contracted before and was certain although that the firſt Leaſe were forfeited or ſurrendred: otherwiſe it is if the firſt Leaſe had bin incertain, as a Leaſe for life; there the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Leaſe had bin good after the Tenants life, not during his life although he ſurrendred or forfeited, unleſſe it had bin by Fine or Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; becauſe Eſtoppels, if the ſecond Leaſe for the ſame years be by Deed Poll, there the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion with the rent paſs by Attornment by the demiſe of the land, by the name of Land; if the poſſeſſion cannot (as a Reverſion upon an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for life, paſſeth by bargaine and ſale of the land by Deed inrolled) and the Grantee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:120227:130"/>may uſe his Deed as he pleaſeth; and therefore may uſe it as a Grant of a Reverſion with attornment, otherwiſe it is, if it be by word, becauſe the Reverſion for years cannot be granted by word. But if Leſſee for years will uſe a Leaſ Poll as a preſent Leaſ where he hath not attornment the Leaſ is void, although the firſt ſurrendred or forfeited as it is if it were by word, becauſe a contract by Deed Poll paſſeth not that which another then injoyes.</p>
               <p>But if the ſecond Leaſe were by Fine or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, and the firſt ſurrendred or forfeited it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="434"/> is good; for if one leaſes land to me which he hath not at the time by Fine or Indenture, and after purchaſe it, or it deſends to him, I may enter and occupy by Eſtoppell, and I ſhall be compelled by Eſtoppell to pay the Rent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every one is concluded to ſay, but that the land paſſeth in poſſeſſion for fourty five yeares by Eſtoppell, and ſhall be good in eſtate to have the other yeares, becauſe they are not incurred in the life time of the Tenants for life: for if the Leaſe for fourtie five yeares had been by word, and the particular Tenant for life had died, the Leſſee ſhould have it againſt the Leſſor.</p>

               <p>Firſt, For that <hi>Sanders</hi> had an evill intent of Murder at the beginning of his Act to kill his Wife; and therefore the conſequent of his Act by which the Daughter dyes, ſhall be adjudged according to the commencement; So if a man ſhoots at one, and kills another, or lyeth in waite to kill one, and kills another; otherwiſe it is where he hath no ill intent of killing any, as to lay poyſon to kill Rats, and one eates of it and dyeth.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:120227:137"/>you to burn the Houſe of <hi>J. S.</hi> and you doe it, and by the fire the Houſe of <hi>J.

               <p>If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="476"/> one be pardoned of Murder, and the wife of the dead ſue an appeale, and a ſtranger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him, and gives him Meate and Drinke, knowing of the Murder and Pardon, he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Fellony againſt the Wife, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that he is not againſt the King, becauſe

For that the Land is charged with this agreement reall, in whoſe hands ſoever it cometh, and therefore the Fee ſhall veſt in the Leſſee by the performance of the Condition diſcharged of all incumbrances made after the Condition, and the previty there is deſtroyed by the Act of the Leſſor, So 6. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Pleſſingtons</hi> Caſe, where a man leaſes for yeares upon Condition perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have Fee, after levies a Fine; the Leſſee performes the Condition, he ſhall have Fee of the Conuſee, but by <hi>Belknap</hi> there he ſhall have the moneys which the Leſſee by his Condition ought to pay: otherwiſe it is if the privity be deſtroyed by the Act of the Leſſee, as where the Leſſee grants his Eſtate, there the Fee ſhall not veſt in him nor his aſſignee 4. (<hi>fol.</hi> 483.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. For anſwer to the ſecond Objection, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="487"/> was ſaid that the Condition ſhall be ſaved by the words which ſhall extend to all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:120227:139"/>Rents, Profits, or other things out of, or in Land, and the ſaving of the right of him which hath not offended ſhall be taken benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.

               <p n="6">6. The anſwer to the third Objection, The Leſſee ought not to ſhew in pleading that he is not excepted in the Statute, for that he gains not any new thing, but will retain the old; and alſo becauſe the Statute is to his diſadvantage, but that he ſhall take benefit of a Statute ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="480"/> anſwer to the fourth Objection, it was ſaid, that admitting that the Fee here ſhall be forfeited to the King without Office, yet the Condition ſhall draw it out of him without Petition, or <hi>Monſtrans de droit,</hi> by ſome, but <hi>Quere</hi> thereof; for otherwiſe it ſhall not veſt at the time of the death of the Lord <hi>Lovell,</hi> it ſhall not veſt at all, for it is appointed to him, as if the Leſſee here had entered into Religion, and the Leſſor without being attainted, had died without iſſue, after the Leſſee is deraigned he ſhall not have the Fee, becauſe it may not veſt in him at the time of the Condition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. So if he was diſſeiſed at that time; And ſo here for to avoid the inconveniency by the operation of the Law or former agreement,<pb n="34" facs="tcp:120227:140"/>a thing ſhall be deveſted out of tho King at the inſtant of the Condition performed without any ſuch circumſtance, As Tenant in Taile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continues; the Diſcontinuee infeoffs the King by Deed inrolled, the King Leaſes to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Taile for life, with the Remainder to his Iſſue for life, the Leſſee dies, the Iſſue, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the remainder falling to him, and the Fee deveſts out of the King without any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. And ſo a Remitter ſhall defeat the Eſtate of the King, and an Office of the King ſhall defeat the Remitter, (<hi>fol.</hi> 488.) as 3. <hi>E.</hi> 4.25. in the Earle of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Caſe, by relation or if the Diſſeiſee enters after the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of his Diſſeiſor. Poſſeſſion of the King by Office, ſhall not be removed without Petition; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="488"/> but if he enter before his Diſſeiſor be attainted, he ſhall be removed without Petition, becauſe the Title of the King there is more antient, and the Office ſhall have relation to the Attainder onely for the profits, although it relate to the time of the Treaſon for to avoid mean Acts and Incumbrances. So Tenant in <hi>Capite</hi> maketh a Leaſe for life, rendring Rent with clauſe of Re-entry for not payment, and dies, his Heire within age enters for the Rent arere: An Office is found, the entry of the Heire for the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion broken is avoyded by <hi>Lovelace</hi> for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Heire, by force of which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, is utterly defeated by Relation, which intitles the King to the Grant. And ſo the entry of the Heire for a thing not due to him, ſhall be adjudged <hi>Tortius</hi> by relation. So if Treſpaſſe, 19. <hi>E.</hi> 4.2. where for things coming of the Land, as Graſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Office avoids the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:120227:140"/>puniſhment againſt thoſe which doe the wrongs and takes it away by relation of the Office (which Intitles the King, becauſe of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat before the Treſpaſſe) an Action once good: But for the entry into the Land, or breaking his Fences, which ariſeth not from the Revenue of the Land, the Action is not gone by the Office.</p>
               <p>If an Office, <hi>virtute Commiſſionis,</hi> be pleaded, he ought to ſhew the authority given by it, and the execution thereof accordingly; becauſe perſons appointed by Commiſſion, have not any other then what is appointed to them by the Commiſſion: otherwiſe it is of an Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken, <hi>virtute Officii,</hi> before the Eſcheator, Sheriffe, Steward of a Leete, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that their authority appeareth to the Court judicially, becauſe it is known by the Law; for that they are Officers of the Common Law.</p>
               <p>A Remainder ought to veſt when it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, otherwiſe it ſhall never veſt. The Kings Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſhall not excuſe any man for the repairing of a Bridge which ought to do it, becauſe it ſhall not take away the Intereſt that the Subjects take therein. So a man pledgeth a Jewell for ten pound and after is attainted, the King ſhall have it without paying of the ten pound. So 13. <hi>R.</hi> 2. the Earle of <hi>Kent</hi> had return of certain Cattell in <hi>Replegiari</hi> and the Proprietor of them is attainted, the Earle ſhall keep them againſt the King, untill he be ſatisfied of the thing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prerogative will not give any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to another.</p>

               <p>Firſt, The firſt exception is becauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is not pleaded with a <hi>Non obſtante,</hi> of the Statute of Mortmaine, and therefore not good by <hi>Dyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Plowden</hi> held the contrary, for that the Grant is good untill Office found, and then hee may well pleade a licence for that time; alſo the Patent is <hi>Excerta ſcientia,</hi> which countervailes the clauſe of <hi>Non obſtante,</hi> for that implies that the King was knowing of the Law; for ignorance indeed may be allowed in the King, ignorance in Law not: So if the King grant Lands to his Villain, the Land paſſeth untill Office; but it is no infranchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe if he was his Villain or not, is a forrain matter, and not apparent to the King. And the Kings Grant ſhall not enure to two intents, where one is forraine matter. The clauſe of <hi>Non obſtante,</hi> is requiſite in a Patent, to be Sheriffe for life, 2. <hi>H.</hi> 7. becauſe the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſaith by preciſe words, That he ſhall not be Sheriffe above one yeare. So a Patent to a Murtherer for pardon; and that he ſhall not finde ſureties, for his good behaviour ought to have a <hi>Non obſtante,</hi> 10. <hi>E.</hi> 3. becauſe this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute avoided the Patent by preciſe words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch ſurety; But the Statute of Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine doth not ſo here, but giveth entry or ſeiſure for a paine, admitting the Grant to be good.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:120227:144"/>
               <p> The ſecond exception was, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent made not them Parſon by expreſſe words by <hi>Dyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond exception was anſwered by <hi>Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who ſaid, becauſe the words amounted to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="503"/> as much, and for that the Kings appeared to be ſo, that it ſhould not be void, becauſe <hi>Ex gratia &amp; mero motu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third exception made by <hi>Dyer,</hi> was, that they did not plead that they entred.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Plowden</hi> anſwered that, becauſe the Patent granted them power to retaine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo they pleaded that they were ſeiſed, which implies an entrie, and in the Common Pleas, uſe upon poſſeſſion executory ſhall ſay ſeiſed onely, without ſaying, that he entred and was ſeiſed.</p>
               <p>The fourth exception that was made by <hi>Dyer,</hi> was, for that they pleaded that they were ſeiſed of the Rectory of the Parſonage of the Deane, in the right of their Cathedrall Church of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> whereas it ſhould be in the right of the Church of the Deane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plowden</hi> anſwered the fourth exception thus, That they plead the ſeiſen of all the intire thing, otherwiſe if it were of parcell of it; or things pertaining to it, for there they ſhould plead that they were ſeiſed of it in the right of the Church of the Deane.</p>
               <p>But Judgement was given for the Biſhop.</p>

               <p>Aſſent to the particular eſtate ſhall reach to the Remainder alſo, but an aſſent to the deviſe of a rent ſhall not extend to the deviſe of the terme, and the deviſe is made of a rent, or common out of the terme, and after of the Land it ſelſe; payment of the rent by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor or his ſufferance for the Deviſee to uſe the common, is not execution of the terme, becauſe the terme is one thing, and the profit out of it is another; but where ſoure yeares of a terme is deviſed to one, and the remainder to another; there otherwiſe it is becauſe all is of one ſame thing, <hi>fol.</hi> 621.524. ſo the ſame <hi>fol.</hi> 541.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The deviſe to the Wife for her life is not an abſolute deviſe of the intire terme, but conditionally, or upon limitation (if ſhe lives
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:120227:145"/>ſo long) for if ſhe dies, her Intereſt is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the limitation, and deviſe to him for his life by implication (becauſe the reſidue of the terme is deviſed to the Son after the death of the Wife, in which is implied that the Wife ſhall have it for her life) and alſo determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the limitation as above ſaid, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to the Son ſhall be expounded to precede the deviſe of the Wife, and ſo both ſhall ſtand, <hi>fol.</hi> 522.523. &amp; 624.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The deviſe to the Wife and Son is of one ſame thing <hi>(ſetlicet)</hi> Of the Land it ſelfe, and the Wife ſhall have the Collaterall occupation onely of the Land by the deviſe; but the very Intereſt and terme of the Land, ſhe ſhall have conditionally, and ſo two parties of one terme, the one to the Wife, and the other to the Son, and then the execution of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="524"/> in the Wife ſhall be execution of the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to the Son.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Alienation of the Wife hath not deveſted the intereſt of the Son, which is accrued to him by the Condition or limitation, nor extinct the Condition or limitation which ſhall transferr the intereſt to him.</p>
               <p>Executor being legatory of a terme by the deviſe of the Teſtator enters generally, he is poſſeſſed as Executor, becauſe it is his firſt title, untill he maketh election to agree to the deviſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="520"/> A Termor grants his terme to one for life, the Grantee ſhall have the intire terme by <hi>Popham,</hi> becauſe for life which is a greater time then for yeares: But <hi>Quere,</hi> if he dies, if the Grant be determined.

Leſſee for yeares grants all his terme which ſhall be arreare after his death, this is voide for the uncertainty; for by the reſervation of the terme for his life, he hath reſerved all the terme, and therefore the Grant which is but one ſentence without any <hi>Habendum,</hi> is voide, 7.

               <p n="1">1.

So a grant of the nomination of the Advowſon is in ſubſtence, a grant of the Advowſon; becauſe the profit of it reſts in the Nomination. So here words of Nomination, and Profits of the Leaſe, is as much as the Leaſe it ſelfe for the time, and not of diſtinct Profits to take alſo, becauſe the Executor here hath not remedy at the Common Law for the

So the educating of the Children here determines her Election, that ſhe taketh the Terme as a Legacy, and her grant after reproves it not, but argues her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy. If a Termer be indebted to one in a hundred pounds, and maketh his Will, and by it deviſe his Terme to his Sonne, and leaves aſſets to pay the debt, the Executor cannot ſell the Terme to pay the debt, but ſhall pay it with the aſſets that he hath in his hands: Adjudged,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:120227:151"/>becauſe he ought to perform all the Will <hi>(ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet)</hi> Debts and Legacies, if there are aſſets.

A gift to his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all his goods for performance of his Will is no deviſe, and a void gift, becauſe the Law giveth them without theſe words: As if a Man deviſe in Fee his Land to his Son, and Heire, it is voyd, becauſe he ſhall have it without the deviſe by diſcent: So for to preſcribe, for to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain for Rent ſervice voyd, becauſe he may diſtrain without preſcription; A deviſe of Fee tayle to his Heire is good, becauſe it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eſtate then he ſhould have by diſcent: So here the Eſtate deviſed to the Wife, which is but percell of the Eſtate <hi>(ſcilicet)</hi> during the Nonage of the Heire is good, becauſe ſevered from that, which the Law would have given to him, and the Clauſe for educating his Children, is not a thing Teſtamentory, nor
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120227:152"/>Legecy to the Children, but is an intent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the deviſe made to the Wife, by which ſhe by her entry hath the Eſtate deviſed to her as Legatory; And the Execution to the Wife is alſo to the Son, becauſe a deviſe, although the Eſtates are ſeverall, and is of the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as if her Eſtate had bin deviſed to another, with the Remainder to her Son, and agreement or aſſent ſhall not be apportioned, as attorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Tenant for life to the Grantee of the Reverſion for life extends to him in Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. So notice given by Tenant for life to the Lord, ſhall ſerve to him in Remainder in Fee, to compell the Lord to avow upon him after the death of the Tenant for life; So Rent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by an Infant at full age of his Leſſee for yeares hath made good the Remiander over.</p>
               <p>An Intruder, cannot gain ſuch Poſſeſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, upon which he may maintain an Action of Treſpaſſe, becauſe the King may puniſh him, 19. <hi>E.</hi> 4.2. and be ſhall not be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly puniſhed; but againſt the Leſſee of the King, one may gain ſuch Poſseſſion, that he may puniſh a Stranger treſpaſsor, yet he ſhall not gain no Eſtate from the Crowne for the Freehold, which irremoveablely reſts in the Crowne; And the King ſhall not alleadge In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion with a <hi>continuando,</hi> but divers dayes <hi>&amp; vicibus;</hi> becauſe he gaineth not any Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion by wrong, (<hi>ſcilicet</hi>) by the Intiuſion againſt the King.</p>

               <p>Firſt, That the Feoffment of tenant in tayl had not diſcontinued, nor deveſted the eſtate of fee in Reverſion out of the King, becauſe it is but a matter in Deed, which is tortious, otherwiſe it is of a rightfull matter of Record, as a Recovery upon a good title or rightfull matter in Deed, as a Remitter or Condition performed; As Alienee of tenant in tayle of the giſt of a common perſon infeoffs the King by Deed inrolled, which regives to the firſt tenant in tayle which dyes, the iſſue euters, it is a Remitter, and therefore the Reverſion in fee is deveſted out of the King, and reſtored to the firſt doner, becauſe a former right; matter in Deed and in Law concurr together: So Leſſee for life to have fee if he doth ſuch an

               <p>Secondly, That by the Feoffment he hath not given the fee determinable, becauſe he had it not, nor an eſtate for life of the Feoffee, but onely an eſtate for his owne life, and ſo the Reverſion in tayle continues in him, which ſhall be forfeit by the Attainder, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the eſtate of the Feoffee determines by the death of the Feoffor; but the Feoffee hath an eſtate for the life of the Feoffor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendable, and his heire ſhall be a ſpeciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupant of this eſtate in baſe fee ſimple.</p>
